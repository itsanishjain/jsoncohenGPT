As a four-time entrepreneur across 24 years, both bootstrapped and VC-funded, resulting in two exits and two unicorns, I’ve also been writing about everything I know for 17 years. I hope you’ll find it useful and entertaining.\\nMostly to support a new startup, I occasionally do short advisory calls through TalkWithMe.\\nFounder \\nWP Engine \\nCurrently I’m the Chief Innovation Officer of WP Engine, which I started in 2010, bootstrapped for two years, then raised a few small rounds, then together with our amazing CEO Heather Brunner a few large rounds totaling over $300M, fueled hyper-growth to a unicorn with 1,200 employees across eight global offices, serving many billions of web requests daily for 200,000 customers as one of the top-ten largest web platforms in the world, and our name on a downtown building that I remember seeing from my car seat growing up in Austin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmart Bear \\nPrior, I bootstrapped Smart Bear for seven years, built it to millions in profit, and sold it in 2007. It changed hands again in 2017 for $450m and in 2020 for nearly $2B. I can’t take credit for the success it enjoyed after I left in 2009, but it certainly had a good foundation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow a conglomerate of beloved software quality products, originally we invented the modern methodology and software for peer code reviews—software developers reviewing each others work, just like authors and editors at a newspaper. I “wrote the book” about code reviews; in the process we conducted the largest in situ study of 2,500 code reviews at Cisco.\\nIT Watchdogs \\nBefore that, co-founder of IT Watchdogs, a hardware + embedded software company making server-room climate and power monitors, which was also bootstrapped and profitable, sold in 2004 and is still producing its products under parent company Vertive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestor \\nSince 2009 I’ve been an investor and time-permitting mentor at Capital Factory, Austin’s major incubator and startup co-working space. I’ve invested in a few companies including AgentPronto, Alto, Apptronik, Armbrust Masks, Builder Prime, Cart.com, Cratejoy, Osano, Pingboard, Signup.com, SpareFoot, StackOverflow, StormPulse, SureSwift, SwimTopia, and Vitag. (And others that didn’t work out, but I’m no less proud to have been a small part of the journey.)\\nSpeaker \\nSome folks enjoy my talks on bootstrapping and startups over the past decade.

While there are other roads to Product/Market Fit, consider copying some of these ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the formula for going from an initial product idea to Product/Market Fit—a company that is growing and sustainable, with customers that want to pay and want to stay.\\n(Assuming you even agree with that definition of Product/Market Fit.)\\nThere isn’t a fail-safe roadmap of course, but there is a progression that describes how WP Engine became a unicorn, supported by 17 years of articles from this site.\\nHere’s what that progression looks like. Then we’ll explore the other truth—that it often doesn’t work like this after all.\\n\\nPersonal Fit: “Passion” is useful, but winning requires a personal edge.\\nMarket Fit: Most good ideas aren’t good businesses.\\nCustomer Fit: Talk to customers before you waste months building the wrong thing.\\nBuild and ship the SLC quickly: It’s where the real learning happens.\\nMarketing and Sales more than writing code and tweaking design.\\nRetention-driven Product development; attend to your existing customers first.\\nPrioritize systematically, ruthlessly, strategically.\\nManage your psychology on a journey of self-discovery and constant rejection.\\n\\n\\n1. Personal Fit: The inner fire, leveraging a personal edge to do what you were meant to do \\nA great idea or a great strategy that you can’t execute well, isn’t a good strategy for you.\\nYou start with nothing—no product, no customers, no brand, no distribution, and compared to competitors, no money and no time.\\nTo succeed, you need something. Something special. Something that gives you an edge, despite being woefully inadequate in every dimension. Is “passion” that something?\\nPassion \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo what you love, and the money will follow.\\n—Motivational advisors\\n\\n\\nThat is false, as evidenced by most artists, philosophy majors, and the 80% of startups that fail despite founders’ genuine love and obsession.\\nPassion is required; it’s just not enough. Passion is the motivator, especially in the dark times when your savings is depleted, competitors are beating you, as you suffer a constant bombardment of rejection from potential customers and potential employees and potential investors, as you question your self-worth and wonder whether the cause of your Impostor Syndrome is that you’re actually an impostor.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you’re not passionate enough from the start, you’ll never stick it out.\\n—Steve Jobs\\n\\n\\nYou need to articulate exactly what your passion is, so that you can use it as a filter for business concept. This is difficult; some people spend their whole life trying to figure it out. Jerry Colonna says “The purpose of life is to discover who you are, and then live fully into that.” It is not an exaggeration to say that a startup is a reflection of who you are; that’s why they call it “your baby.”\\nSee the last section of this article on personal fulfillment for a list of questions that help you suss what your purpose and passions are.\\nYour goal is to find the work you were meant to do. Your calling. The work that you would do for free, but more—what you are compelled to do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, the existence of passion doesn’t imply the existence of a business model. (We’ll solve that in the next step.) Passion doesn’t give you a competitive edge, because all the other founders have passion, and larger companies have mountains of advantages that make “passion” look like a sling-shot attacking an aircraft carrier. You need an edge.\\nLeverage \\n“Leverage” means yielding a huge output from a given input—accomplishing an inordinate amount of quantity or quality, with relatively little time and money. You generate leverage from the mixture of talents, taste, and experiences that you possess. To figure out how this works for you, see this article for many types and examples of leverage.\\nLeverage is good, but unique leverage is far better, because that’s your source of differentiation1 from competitors and alternatives. Often this appears at the intersection of your peculiar above-average talents and experiences, which taken together are unique2. This uniqueness must then be coupled with a particular way that you are approaching this problem and solution, such that the combination of your leverage against your path is uniquely excellent, even for a small number of potential customers.\\nThis leverage + path combination also forms the kernel of your strategy3 as your competitive positioning. You need something that competitors lack, because your customers are going to compare you to competitors whether you like it or not, and you have to have an answer besides “we have this one minor feature that they don’t have” or “we’re $10 cheaper.”\\n\\n1\\n “Different,” not “better.” Yes, you will be “better” for according to some set of people, but definitionally that means you’re “worse” for another set. The latter might even be orders of magnitude more numerous than the former. That’s OK, and that’s why I don’t like using the word “better.” You should be distinctive, aligned with your calling and your strengths, so that the set of people who do find your brand of different to be “better” will flock to you, buy from you, and even love paying you for it.\\n2\\n The quintessential exponent of this idea is Scott Adams, writer of the Dilbert cartoon, who points out that he is a decent illustrator but not a great one, a decent humorist but worse than any comedian on Netflix, and has held jobs in the tech sector, unlike almost any artist or comedian. It is in the intersection of being in the top 25% in each of these three “circles of competence” that he is unique, not because he is top 1% or “best in the world” at any one thing.\\n3\\n Leveraging strengths into durable competitive advantage is one of the six characteristics of great strategy.\\nThe key question that summarizes this intersection of “you” and “path” is:\\nWhy are you the perfect person to build this company?\\n\\n\\n\\nBe yourself. Everyone else is taken.\\n—Oscar Wilde\\n\\n\\n2. Market Fit: A working theory of why they will buy. \\nOnce you inventory the inner world—the shapes of spaces where you were meant to play—you turn your gaze externally to figure out whether your idea works out in the market, in the world of customers, competitors, trends, problems-to-solve, jobs-to-be-done, and products. These things you do not control, and thus must understand, conform to, but also exploit.\\nIt’s right there in the name: “Product/Market Fit” means fitting into the market, not just building something that would be fun/interesting/edifying/curious/exciting/ego-enhancing. Those are all good reasons to have a side-project, but none is a reason why that side-project will become a profitable business, even at a scale that feeds a single person. That’s why most “indie hacker” startups and “AI is cool” startups fail—the genesis was “fun project,” not “plausible business.”\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n“I had the problem myself, so I built a product to solve it.”\\nThis might be the most common origin story, tacitly concluding that “this must be a business because I would have been a customer.” Indeed, my startups all started this way. But your understanding of “the problem” as it pertains to you alone is much less likely to be a real business than you think. You are, in fact, not like your customer4.\\n\\n4\\n For a start, your customer isn’t quitting their day job to create a business.\\nSometimes a passion project turns into a business anyway. That’s what happened to me at Smart Bear. More on that later. But that’s luck. The point of a framework like this one is to reduce your reliance on luck.\\n\\n“The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It’s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.\\nThe very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they’re something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.”\\n—Paul Graham, How to Get Startup Ideas\\n\\nA theory of why they will buy \\nYou need a plausible theory of the customer, market, and business model. “Plausible,” because many ideas fall apart under honest scrutiny. “Theory” because of course it won’t be entirely correct, but it will be your working understanding of the world, which you modify as you learn.\\nHere’s exactly how to develop a specific theory of the market, customer, and your positioning. You’ll analyze these market characteristics:\\n\\nPlausible: Do 10M people or 100k companies have the problem?\\nSelf-Aware: Do they know & care they have the problem?\\nLucrative: Do they have substantial budget to solve this problem?\\nLiquid: Are they willing and able to buy right now?\\nEager: Do they want to buy from you, specifically?\\nEnduring: Will they still be paying(-it-forward) a year from now?\\n\\nA lot of people read that article, then said they wish they had read it before they wasted two years of their life (and savings and heartache) building [insert name of failed startup]. Don’t be one of those people.\\nYou might think it infeasible to answer these questions, because the research is impossible or the idea is so new that existing data and trends are irrelevant. However, as you’ll see in the article, you can do it using Fermi Estimation—a technique useful not only in market analysis but for ROI, probabilities, and decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly strategy \\nEven better than having a great business model is to have a great strategy. Not a twenty-page document, but a one-pager that conforms to the guidelines in that article, explaining “how we will win.” It’s never too early to be asking yourself how to leverage your strengths to build products that are great and differentiated despite your weaknesses. It’s never too early to write down your assumptions and decisions, to ensure they are at least self-consistent if not self-reinforcing, so that when contrary evidence appears, you can notice that, and react methodically.\\nTo generate tangible strategic ideas for your business model or strategy—explaining “how we will win”—consider creating a theory of where your product will fit in the customer’s Needs Stack, pick a few of these tactics for navigating the fact that the future is unpredictable, and decide how you will generate “Love” and “Utility” types of Willingness-to-Pay. All of these are fun, accessible, strategic, and they work in practice.\\n“But often the first idea is wrong, so why do I need a specific idea with a specific business model?”\\nBecause walking in a random direction is not progress, and because the main way to discover the right direction, is to have a clear theory of the world, and notice when the world contradicts it, so you can pivot into a better theory, and thus iterate into a genuinely great strategy and market-understanding.\\nThat’s what actually happened with Smart Bear, and Slack and WhatsApp and Flickr, as described and analyzed here. Only by having a specific, strong, clear idea, was it possible to notice what customers really wanted instead, which led each of those companies to pivot into the idea that became successful.\\nIn all those cases, the idea was very personal to the founders—the personal-fit of passion for the solution and leveraging an edge to create something that resonated with early users. But it was only with a specific theory of business model and strategy, which was then negated by reality, and then an intentional pivot, to achieve Product/Market Fit.\\n3. Customer Fit: Find the ideal customers first. \\nThere’s only one source of truth for what customers will buy: Customers.\\nNot advisors, not experts, not analysts, not Twitter polls, not research, not past data, not even competitors’ behavior. You have to talk to customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers are fickle. You ask whether they’ll pay $100 if your product does ______ and they say “yes;” then you build it and they don’t buy. So why talk to them at all? Don’t you need to put the actual product in front of them, and see what they actually do?\\nCustomers can tell you what their lives are like, which is how you validate your business model and strategy from the previous section. Customers can tell you what they won’t buy, which has happened to me repeatedly. You can discover that the average customer doesn’t know the problem exists, or doesn’t have a budget for it, or isn’t prioritizing it. When they say “yes,” it’s a “maybe,” but when they say “no,” it’s a “no,” and you just saved yourself months or years of wasted time.\\nYou can find out where they go to find products like this, so that you can advertise in the right place. You can find out what language they use to talk about the problem or solution, so you can copy that language in your advertising and social media home page and capture their attention. You can find out how their budgets work, so you can price and package and position accordingly. You can find out how they’re addressing the problem today, so you know what you’re selling against, whether that’s a competitor, an alternative, or something they’re doing by hand. You can find out what causes them to break out of their daily life and say as Bob Moesta puts it, “Today is the day I’m going to buy ______,” so that you can try to be there when that event happens, or possibly even cause it.\\nIt is easy to find examples of successful companies who never asked customers what they wanted. That happened to me at Smart Bear. But again that relies on luck, and most of the time, you don’t get lucky. This is not a good way to gamble the next few years of your life.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\nBut you don’t want to do this work. You want to build the product because that’s the fun part. Potential customers are hard to find and they don’t want to talk to you. It’s going to be like that when you have a product too, so if you can’t do it now, you won’t be able to do it later. Building the product first won’t make it easier to find or talk to customers. Building the product first will, however, ensure that you haven’t actually built what people want, because you never found out what people want.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to interview customers \\nOnce you get someone on the phone, how do you interview them in a way that maximizes learning and leads to a specific theory that you can execute on, from your unique winning advantage to pricing?\\nThe customer validation system I’ve developed is the Iterative-Hypothesis customer development method. This provides you with goals that you achieve using interviews, how to create the hypotheses that will drive your business model, and how to write questions that maximize learning. 15 years ago it invalidated a startup idea that I thought was good, and then validated the startup idea that became WP Engine—now a unicorn.\\nHow to get customers to talk to you \\nThe way I got interviews for WP Engine is by using LinkedIn to find people who had the title and industry I was targeting (web developers in WordPress), and asked them for an hour of their time to chat about a new startup concept for whom they are the ideal customer. Furthermore I offered to pay any amount they wished for that hour, because I value their expertise and their time; I’m not asking for a donation, I’m genuinely interested in their expertise. Out of 50 requests, 40 agreed, and only one asked to be paid. (30 eventually became customers.)\\nAnother technique is to buy ads for a landing page with an email sign-up form and web-chat, and talk to the people who arrive. Ask what they’re looking for, what they need it for, why are they looking for it right now, how they found you, and what else they’re considering. When it goes well, ask them to hop on the phone and run the full method above.\\nAnother technique: Go to an event where your target customers are, walk the halls, and interview everyone all day long. People like talking about themselves, and you get to hone your pitch with 100 practice sessions.\\nMore techniques:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind your ICP \\nYour goal is not only to validate your theory of the market, but to discover your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile). This is your “perfect customer”—a segment almost comically over-specified to be so perfect for your product that you are truly the best choice in the market, and they would be crazy not to buy. You will then aim all of your marketing messaging at this person: Website, advertisement, terminology, writing style, pricing. When the ICP lands on the home page, it should be obvious in three seconds that this is perfect for them, that you “get” them, and they will be pulled through the process until they’re a customer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are scared that targeting only the ICP limits your potential market, but this is not what happens. In “Selling to Carol,” I explain the mechanism and provide examples showing that for every ICP there are 10x more people who make similar buying decisions, and 100x more who take more convincing but ultimately also agree, and therefore you end up selling to a far wider market than you feared, yet earning attention and loyalty from having a clear, unique message. Your company, brand, and product will actually mean something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind and talk to the customers; they’re the only ones with the answers.\\n4. Build and ship the SLC. \\nInterviews give you a better model of the world, but the real learning doesn’t start until people are using—or more often, not using—a product.\\nSLC is my alternative to MVP:\\nSimple, because complex things can’t be built quickly, and you need to ship product to customers now.\\nLovable, because crappy products are insulting to customers, and you didn’t start this company to make crappy products. The love overpowers the fact that it’s buggy and feature-poor. There are many wonderful, powerful, competitively-defensible forms of “Love.” Pick a few.\\nComplete, because products are supposed to accomplish a job. Customers want to use a v1 of something simple, not v0.1 of something broken.\\nBuild something small (but also lovable and complete), and ship it to customers, because that’s when real “progress” begins. That’s how you learn the truth.\\nIf you’re building for six months and a customer hasn’t used it, you’re not on the road to Product/Market Fit; indeed you’re not making progress on the business at all. What you’ve done is proved what you already knew—you can build software.\\nThe learning starts only when customers are (trying to) use it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Focus more on marketing and sales, less on product. \\nYour natural inclination is to do what you enjoy and understand, so you need to press yourself to do so much marketing and sales that it feels like “too much.”\\nAsk yourself: What can you do today, that will (a) get more people from the target market to come to the website or (b) convert more of those people to try the product or (c) convert more of those to buy the product.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe answer might be found in writing more code. Improving the new-user experience, for example, could increase the conversion rate from “try” to “buy.” But more often the answer isn’t inside the product; indeed several of those steps happen before the person has used the product at all.\\nYou’ll advance the product anyway—I know that. And you should, but you don’t need to be told to do that. After all, it’s all you ever wanted to do, even at step one. That’s why you need to set an intention every day to make progress on one of those questions. That’s how you’re going to generate growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. Prioritize retention-based product work. \\nWhat does it mean, that one person out of billions cared enough about your problem-space to notice your advertisement or social media post, then felt compelled to follow the link, then was so intrigued by the website that they joined the 1-out-of-100 that tried the product, then liked what they saw enough to take out their wallet and pay, then started to use it… and then cancelled?!?\\nAfter all that—clear signals of desire, need, willingness to pay, and apparent “fit”—they decided “Nope, this is not what I want.”\\nWhat it means is: You made the right promise, but didn’t keep it.\\nMarketing is where you discover the promise the customer wants you to make, and retention5 is where you discover whether you’re fulfilling that promise.\\n\\n5\\n Actually, retention is a lagging, multi-factor indicator, which makes it useful as a high-level check, but not useful as an operational day-to-day metric. Here’s a complete system for practical metrics that embraces this fact and points to the right set of metrics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome people believe that low retention is fine because you can make up for it with growth. That’s not true for two reasons:\\n\\nGrowth will start out good, but then will slow and halt sooner than you realize6.\\nIf customers don’t want to use the product, your “growth” is fake news. It’s not Product/Market “Fit” if the “market” decides “not a fit” after actually using the product.\\n\\n\\n6\\n See these articles with data from Product/Market fit companies and the math behind growth grinding to a halt at companies with low retention.\\nTherefore, when you do work on product features, build things that increase retention.\\nThis starts by understanding why people cancel. Gaining this understanding is difficult, because once they leave they don’t want to talk to you anymore. You might coerce them by paying for interviews with Amazon gift cards or charitable donations. Some people will respond to an email (no harm in asking). Better is to look for signs that the customer isn’t being successful (e.g. activity within the product) and reach out before it’s too late, while they’re still in the middle of their struggle, and therefore might be willing and able to articulate it.\\nRemember that your goal is not to discover what unsuccessful customers have in common, because successful customers often have those things in common as well. Rather, it is to find patterns in unsuccessful customers that are not shared by successful customers. Those are the attributes that lead to action.\\nFor example, if “using feature X” means people are successful, maybe unsuccessful customers don’t know about it (so you promote its usage), or maybe they can’t use it because it’s incompatible with their workflow (so add integrations or options). Sometimes, however, it’s about the customers themselves, where tuning the ICP means you find more customers who are already a fit, perhaps targeting different industries or geographies, different stages or sizes of company, the title or attitude of the buyer, or the specific use-cases they are trying to solve for.\\nThe Talk/Walk workshop might help, because it helps elucidate the difference between the promise and the execution. But probably, as usual, you just need to talk to customers.\\n7. Ruthlessly, methodically, systematically prioritize. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore than just “focus,” more than a generic admonition to “prioritize,” use a system that ensures you’re leveraging your most valuable, most limited asset (time) to maximize progress.\\nDo this by combining Fairytale Planning with the Rocks, Pebbles, Sand work-prioritization system:\\n\\nIdentify the next milestone.\\nAt all times, be crystal clear about the single most important thing to achieve.\\n(Ex: Finding a good business model. Public launch. 20 paying customers. Getting trial conversion rates from 1% to 5%. Getting cancellation from 7%/mo to 4%/mo. Getting to $10k MRR so you can quit your day job.)\\nYou have to be executing against the next milestone every day. Write it down and look at it every morning. Everything else is a distraction to be ignored, or a necessary evil that you should dispatch as quickly as possible, including delegation or accepting that it’s fine if it’s executed poorly or late.\\nIdentify the current obstacle to achieving the milestone.\\nAt all times, be crystal clear why it is difficult or slow or expensive to achieve that milestone.\\n(Ex: Can’t figure out how to leverage your strengths for something differentiated and desirable. Easy to get someone to use it once, but only 15% use it again. Got 17 customers from Product Hunt but now there’s no repeatable way to get more. Can’t get people to agree to be interviewed. SLC isn’t accepted by beta testers. Freemium users don’t have enough incentive to convert to paid.)\\nYou must face the difficult truth. Do not pick the obstacle that feels comfortable; pick the existential crisis that is uncomfortable exactly because it is critical and scary and true.\\nYou have to be attacking or side-stepping the obstacle every day. Write it down and look at it every morning.\\nSplit work into Rocks, Pebbles, Sand.\\nUse this specific Rocks, Pebbles, Sand framework to prioritize and schedule different types of work with the correct philosophy and process appropriate for each type.\\nSelect the Rock that attacks the obstacle and milestone together.\\nUse Binstack to prioritize one Rock that addresses that most important milestone and attacks the obstacle. (You don’t have time for more than one.)\\nIf you can’t think of one that’s good enough, don’t just proceed with a mediocre plan that will occupy the next three months; grab some friends—or better yet, customers!—and brainstorm a better one.\\nSchedule Pebbles sparingly.\\nBecause you have to focus on the Rock, and you have little time for anything else, use this ROI framework to prioritize just a few other activities that are valuable enough to justify spending your remaining time.\\nAlmost everything should be only “good enough”\\nYou have taste, you have craft, and part of the reason you’re doing all this is to express yourself. But almost everything you do will not determine whether the company is successful. (Repeat that last sentence until you fully internalize it.) Which means most things should only be “good enough.” Let it go.\\nMost metrics should be satisfied, not maximized. Pick KPIs accordingly.\\nHaving said all that, sometimes the very best aspects of a design are the little things, the obsessive things, the things you are compelled to make just so. Whether web design or UX design or a “perfect” feature which is only perfect because of the myriad corner cases that took a surprising amount of code and care to cover, but which means a new customer has an amazing experience. Pick your battles.\\n\\nDon’t stray from the system. You don’t have the time.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n8. Manage your psychology. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThroughout this a step-by-step roadmap, you face demanding psychological challenges.\\n\\nFacing the truth—not allowing “what you wish were true” to get in the way of finding out what is true, about your abilities, customer’s wishes, the shape of the market, why people leave.\\nFinding yourself—coming face-to-face with who you are, and who you are not, figuring out what is actually important versus what is necessary or temporary, enjoying the journey especially when even a successful end result is often not what you hoped it would be.\\nMaking clear decisions—deciding what you’re not good at, and not trying to do it anyway; deciding your place in the market, and not trying to be all things to all people; deciding your ICP and having the fortitude to go all-in; deciding the current milestone, the main challenge, the one big thing you have to do, and sticking to it without getting distracted.\\nConstant rejection—your ideas won’t be good enough, your customer interviews will negate key assumptions, 99% of website visitors won’t take an action, long sales calls will result in nothing, customers will buy but then leave, employees won’t join you, investors won’t invest.\\nFluid change—despite clear decisions, rejections often demand a change, which is difficult to accept, difficult to enact, difficult to admit when things are wrong, and difficult to decide whether some rejection should be ignored as an anomaly, or whether it’s indicative of a “learning” that must result in a change.\\nActing while uncertain—being “all-in” even while knowing you must be wrong about some things, even while getting rejected and making changes, even while doing things you’ve never done while experts tell you what to do differently, even while feeling like an impostor who has no right to be here, even while knowing you have no idea what you are doing while it appears everyone else knows exactly what they’re doing. (Don’t worry, they really don’t.)\\n\\nThis might be the hardest thing you’ve ever done. It’s a gauntlet of pain, even if it’s also the most exciting thing you’ll do in your professional life. Many people stop because it’s so hard. You can’t blame them.\\n\\nBut you’re not going to do this, are you… \\nYou have a fun feature idea so you’re just building it.\\nYou always wanted to learn Rust so you’re just learning it.\\nAI is astounding and it’s the future so you’re building things with it, even though it’s a technology and not a customer’s problem that needs solving.\\nYou’ve started your own company in part because you don’t want to be shackled by “processes” and “frameworks,” so you’re just doing whatever you want.\\nVisual Studio is comfortable and Google Ad Manager is foreign and like Las Vegas is designed to separate you from your money, to say nothing of the discomfort of asking for the sale or getting someone on a call to talk about their workflows or get an earful about how your precious software actually sucks.\\nUncomfortable. Scary. And you’re lost, unskilled at those things, not making progress, not even wanting to. So you slip back to Visual Studio where you know what to do, and enjoy doing it, and you’re good at it.\\nThen you post on Twitter about how you have $1600 in MRR after 18 months but it’s okay because perseverance is a virtue. When in fact you’ve fallen into the well-known trap of doing what you’re good at, what you love, but not what the business needs done.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\nPerseverance is a virtue, if you’re doing the right work, with the right goals. It’s a vice if it means you’re moving diligently in the wrong direction.\\nSmart Bear only halfway followed the roadmap \\nBut who am I to talk?\\nThe company I founded in 2002, sold in 2007, and that gave me the online handle that persists to this day on this site, Smart Bear’s first “product” Code Historian was a personal project, built because I want to learn .NET (we would later rewrite everything in Java), built because I thought there was value in the historical record encoded in version control (all products that operated under that assumption failed).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis doesn’t make me look old, right? Right???\\n\\n\\nI didn’t talk to customers ahead of time. I did talk to them a lot after they started paying, and learned that many didn’t really want Code Historian at all, but rather they were abusing it to accomplish something else (in a story told here). As a result, I created Code Reviewer, which sort of hit the need in question, but the architecture was all wrong and the features were all hacks. But all this customer feedback gave me the confidence to rewrite everything from scratch (which everyone says you should never do), resulting in a product called Code Collaborator, which made millions of dollars.\\nWould I have found the idea for Code Collaborator by interviewing customers using the “Iterative-Hypothesis” method above? No, because I wouldn’t have known what to ask them, and they wouldn’t have known to tell me. I would have discovered that Code Historian wasn’t a good business idea… and that’s it. Maybe I would have had a completely different and better idea. Maybe. But the fact is, the actual “path to success” was to create something I liked, just interesting enough to attract initial customers even though it’s not a great business, and then pivot to Code Reviewer, and then pivot to Code Collaborator. The interviews would have stopped everything cold. Does that make “interviewing” the wrong road to Product/Market Fit?\\nI do think building and getting product into customers hands is far more valuable than conversations. Smart Bear was an example of (1) having a specific idea matching my passions, which then because of (4) building and shipping and (5) marketing and selling and (6) building for retention by talking to customers, lead to the right idea. So, it was part of the path, but not the full path.\\nSo, while the path to success didn’t honor every step in the roadmap, it still would have failed if I had violated those other steps—coding in isolation, coding instead of selling, coding instead of honestly figuring out what customers really wanted.\\nWP Engine followed the roadmap and became a unicorn \\nThat said, with WP Engine I traveled this roadmap exactly.\\nWP Engine wasn’t the initial idea. The first idea was for a marketing analytics tool with features that Google Analytics lacked: A real-time event dashboard, a clever goal-setting-and-measuring system that worked retroactively, and the ability to capture web-form data even when it was only partially filled-in and never submitted, all with just one line of Javascript7. But I ran that Iterative-Hypothesis method and after 20 interviews I learned that the idea wasn’t strong enough8. I was on the road; I (1) had a specific idea that (2) was clearly a great market and (3) vetted it with customers. Thanks to (3), I did not waste years on that project.\\n\\n7\\n These features are typical of analytics tools today, but in 2009 it was innovative.\\n8\\n This article gives the details of this invalidation, and how it was different from WP Engine, which the same method validated.\\nI then had the idea of a managed WordPress platform because I needed it myself—my blog would crash when I got to the top of Hackernews (a link-sharing site). I asked other bloggers what they use to keep WordPress fast and scalable; many said, “I don’t know, but if you find it, tell me, because I need that too.” I ran the Iterative-Hypothesis method again, and this time it was very clear what the need was, what people would pay, and how to find them. And the market was already huge (WordPress powered 11% of the largest 10 million websites) yet growing fast (in 2023 it’s 43%). I knew WordPress because I was a user, and for nearly twenty years I’ve loved code optimization problems, so this was a problem I understood and am ideal to solve, where customers agree the problem exists, are already spending money on it, and the market is large and growing. That’s steps (1), (2), and (3), but this time the concept was validated.\\nI built just enough software to fulfill the promises of speed and scale, building the first version in 30 hours. Good enough to not only stay alive and fast on a Hackernews day, but with almost no load on the server, which meant I was still far away from a capacity limit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHundreds of simultaneous connections on a Hackernews day in 2010\\n\\n\\nThe first version didn’t even have a customer dashboard. I took credit cards with the default web-form supplied by the online credit card service, and the rest was just WordPress.\\nThe first version of the website was… “spare,” shall we say?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second version of the website was so bad, there were database errors shooting out the bottom. Database errors, on the home page, of the company that you’re supposed to trust with your precious website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe market need must be overwhelming, if customers walk through this wall of fire and say “yeah just take my money.”\\n\\n\\nSo that’s step (4), the SLC product that fulfills the job completely with the absolute minimum of “Product.”\\nWe reached $1M ARR after 18 months. The reason—besides having the right product with the right promise in the right market, which was elements (2) and (3)—is step (5) focus on marketing and sales.\\nBecause I did marketing and sales before even having a product login screen, I was able to launch with 30 paying customers. Sure I worked on the product and worked support tickets, but what I focused on was how to get customers:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom an “advisory group” email update from 2010; my asks were for marketing and sales, not product and engineering.\\n\\n\\nWhen you do marketing and sales, with a product that people actually need, in a large and growing market (all covered by the exercise under (2)), then you might have a nice growth curve:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHit $1M ARR in first 18 months at WP Engine.\\nBut wait, the Product/Market Fit is still to come…\\n\\n\\nWe’ve always spent a lot of time on (6) retention. Sometimes years would pass where we wouldn’t add a new feature, because all our engineering time was spent on the challenges of scale and continuing to improve on the promise of speed and uptime. As a result, we’ve had best-in-industry customer retention for 14 years.\\nHigh retention due to happy customers folds back into growth through word-of-mouth referrals and a thousand top-of-class reviews:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that, combined with the hard work, the craftsmanship, the large and growing market—did I mention the large and growing market?—and yes also the luck, meant that in early 2012 we hit Product/Market Fit, as further detailed here:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe previous chart’s “up and to the right” growth from 2010-2012 looks almost flat compared to the sudden moment of Product/Market Fit, when it became hyper-growth, and never slowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis roadmap worked for WP Engine, and it worked for others. Consider this thread from Simon Hoiberg, explaining why his second bootstrapped company succeeded (FeedHive) where his first failed. This roadmap echos within it—playing in a large, growing market, finding and focusing on an ICP, building only an SLC to start, and treating marketing and sales as more important than features and innovation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you have to walk this road like Simon discovered with FeedHive and I discovered at WP Engine, or can you stumble onto it halfway through like Smart Bear, or can you take a completely different route and just emerge at the finish line? Or can you just cherry-pick the things you like from this framework, and ignore the rest?\\nYes to all the above. Everything is possible.\\nBut not all roads are equally likely to result in success. We enjoy stories about outliers because exceptions are interesting. But exceptions are not repeatable, and therefore they may not be teaching you anything useful. I believe the roadmap above is repeatable. Not a guarantee of success, but a process that makes sense.\\nIt’s your life; you can take any road you please.\\nWhat are you going to do?\\n\\nMany thanks to Gordon Daugherty, Rowan Udell, and Sathyanand S for contributing insights to early drafts.\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/product-market-fit-formula/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe roadmap to Product/Market Fit (PMF)… maybe\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)1.

A subset of those things is the path “Problem” to “Viable Business Model.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s dive in.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nPlausible: Do 10M people or 100k companies have the problem? \\nThese numbers sound larger than necessary, but here’s why it is necessary even for an indie startup, using Fermi Estimation:\\n\\n1% conversion: Impression → Visitor\\nAn AdWords campaign with multiple keywords, ads, and bids would be very successful at a 2% click-through rate. Display ads are more like 0.3%-0.5%. (source: HubSpot)\\nTop SEO position can be 3%-5%, but that’s almost impossible to achieve for even a mildly competitive keyword. (source: HubSpot)\\n1% conversion: Visitor → Paid\\nA typical, successful product website converts 1% of its traffic to paying customers. I don’t have firm data, though I did an informal poll on this question years ago. Some data show 2-5% conversion rate even for just a sign-up form or free trial, of which a fraction will become paying customers.\\nTherefore: 10,000 Impressions → 1 paying customer\\n10,000 × (1% click-through) × (1% convert-to-pay) = 1.\\n10,000,000 Impressions → 1,000 paying customers\\nNot every impression will be a unique person, but you still need closer to 10M potential eyeballs than to 1M, because while some people will see your material more than once, most of the market will never see your material.\\n\\n1,000 paying customers is the minimum1 needed for a sustainable, small company. It will take about two years2, 10M marketing impressions, and luck.\\n\\n1\\n This is a rough rule of thumb companies charging $30-$100/mo; if less, you’ll need even more customers to become sustainable; if more, you need fewer customers, but they are more difficult to find and convert than the numbers above suggest. Pricing determines your business model.\\n2\\n WP Engine, the company I started over a decade ago, was a hyper-growth company and then a Unicorn, reaching $100M in ARR in a similar timeframe to other hyper-growth companies (as in the chart mid-way through this article), now with over 200,000 customers, yet it took two years to get the first 1,000 customers. Competitors who started after us also took that long, and there are many many many many many many many many many many other examples. Of course it can also take forever, 4 years, 6 months, or 52 hours, because this is a rule of thumb, not a law of physics.\\nIf you’re selling directly to consumers, there needs to be 10M who have the problem, otherwise it’s too small even for an indie company who wants to stay small forever.\\nIf you’re selling to businesses, the total number of potential customers is an order of magnitude smaller, but they will pay orders-of-magnitude more to solve problems, and conversion rates are higher, thus 100k is sufficient.\\nReal-world data reinforcing this point; a relatively high 4% conversion from home page to paid, though 25% of those return to Freemium after just one month:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nTrung Phan’s conversion funnel for AI research app Bearly.ai\\n\\n\\nA lot of great ideas attack problems that just aren’t actual problems, at least not for more than a small handful of people, and therefore fail to yield a successful company.\\nCan you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule. For example, a high-price-tag product in a small niche can be a fine company. Or, perhaps you’re happy staying frugal, never hiring an employee, and making $100,000/year post-expenses post-tax, replacing a salary but on your own terms3. That’s wonderful. You can be the exception, but with conditions.\\n\\n3\\n This is, in fact, what 80% of small businesses do. It is a vibrant and valuable driver of fulfillment and the economy; ignore those who claim this is somehow less important than “swinging for the fences.” Rather, there are two kinds of companies: Those which endeavor to replace a salary (and then some), and those who are trying to become huge, and they are simply different paths.\\nSelf-Aware: Do they know & care they have the problem? \\nIt seems like the answer should be “obviously yes,” but often the answer is “shockingly no.”\\nIf a person does not already believe they have a problem, they will not be surfing the Internet looking for a solution, and even if they happen upon your website somehow, you cannot get them to spend money to solve a problem they don’t think they have.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSam Altman is the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, and before that ran the Y-Combinator accelerator, and is therefore one of the world’s most experienced experts on startups. He previously co-founded Loopt—a location-based, mobile social-network app. Oh look, those are all the keywords of 2005, when it was founded. It raised $30M and failed. When asked what happened, he said:\\n\\nThe market wasn’t there. You can’t force a market. You can have an idea, and as a startup part of your job is to be ahead of it, and sometimes you’re right about that, and sometimes you’re not.\\nSometimes you make Loopt, and sometimes you make OpenAI. You just keep trying.\\n—Sam Altman, interviewed by Kara Swisher\\n\\nI’ve given the example of website security, which I know4 is a real problem plaguing millions of websites whose owners think “those mean hackers won’t attack lil’ ol’ me; I’m nobody!” False. Hackers indeed don’t care about lil’ ol’ you, but they do want to gain control of your lil’ ol’ server, so they can do their nefarious things, like spamming, advertisement-click-fraud, remote-controlling your visitors’ browsers, or just bouncing off to yet another server as a way of covering their tracks. Everyone has the problem, but millions of people don’t think they have the problem, so they’re not searching for website security software, and certainly not buying it.\\n\\n4\\n A million websites run on WP Engine’s platform, serving tens of billions of requests daily, as 9% of the global online population visits a WP Engine property every day. We block hundreds of millions of nefarious requests daily, and internally run SOC Type II and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified security processes. So we know a lot about what hackers do to websites large and small.\\n“Security” is a case of ignorance, but the other version of this challenge is when the customer knows they have the problem, but genuinely does not care. This could be because this problem is the ninth-most-important priority on their list, and they can only give attention to their top three… and this item will never bubble up to the top three. An example I see a lot at WP Engine is accessibility5. Given lip-service by many marketing departments and product managers, it rarely makes the priority list for the public website or the product. Some companies choose to care, or are mandated by governments or contracts. This author chooses to care6. But the fact is, though everyone agrees they have the “problem” of a non-accessible website or product, most don’t have the will to act.\\n\\n5\\n “Accessibility” means working well for people with various challenges; in the visual sphere, consider cases like red/green color-blindness, needing high-contrast colors, needing larger text, or complete blindness, needing “screen reader” browsers to navigate menus, forms, and content.\\n6\\n This site uses semantic tags for content and navigation, the entire stylesheet of both fonts and layout supports arbitrary changes in font size, automatically respecting browser-specific settings, supplies keyboard shortcuts for menu actions, has alt-text for all images, uses aria-title and related attributes, uses high-contrast foreground/background colors, also supports high-contrast mode, and works well in screen-readers (including those built for everyone, like Safari Reader and Readwise Reader and Pocket). That said, let me know if there’s more I could be doing!\\nSometimes “willing and able” is a matter of market-timing. A famous example is Instacart: Successful after 80% of Americans carried a smart phone, unlike WebVan which was exactly the same idea, solving the same problem in much the same way, but the market wasn’t ready for it.\\nA lot of great ideas, attacking real problems, fail to become successful companies, because the target market doesn’t know they’re even in the market. Because they’re not.\\nCan you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule. Some founders are not only the first-and-best sales-person, but also natural evangelists. More, they’re on a mission to educate the world about their passion. They don’t see a lack of interest as a barrier, but as an opportunity to change minds. That is a difficult, expensive, and slow path7, but it is a path, and one that could result in zealous, loyal customers and a fulfilling existence. But you really have to want that path, doing that work with those consequences, if you’re going to enter a market that you also have to create.\\n\\n7\\n “Difficult” because changing someone’s mind about anything is almost impossible, especially when they’re not seeking to have their mind changed. “Expensive” because of the marketing and attention you have to bring to the cause, on top of the usual work of making a sale, with certainly-worse-than-average conversion rates. “Slow” because you’re having to create demand and then fulfill it, rather than meet demand that already exists.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nLucrative: Do they have substantial budget to solve this problem? \\n\\n“You have a great product! I’d have to get [someone else’s] approval for this though, and they don’t understand all this.”\\n“This is nice, I would use it, but they’re carefully watching all expenditures and the truth is I can manage without it.”\\n“I’d love to, but our budget is closed for the year and I can’t start a new project.”\\n“This is pretty cool, but our internal team who manages [the problem] says they don’t need help. They might be just trying to save their jobs, but it is what it is.”\\n\\nWe’ve all heard these objections. Some are normal; you can’t win every sale. But sometimes the target customer agrees they have the problem, yet doesn’t have the money to solve it.\\nAt Capital Factory8, there’s a constant stream of kids coming out of college with a startup that “sells ______ to college students.” It’s easy to find “problems”—restaurants and bars want to advertise to students, students don’t want to spend much on food, students need books and supplies, and so on. The founders explain they “had the problem themselves, so they really understand it.”\\n\\n8\\n Capital Factory is by far Austin’s largest and most prolific “Center of gravity for entrepreneurs in Texas,” now a tiered system from co-working to mentoring to multi-million-dollar investments with hundreds of companies in orbit. The University of Texas, also in Austin, has a high-quality Computer Science department that is also one of the largest in the country.\\nThat’s probably true. The deal-breaker is that college kids have no money, and don’t spend what little money they have on SaaS products. And businesses that cater to college kids have to charge low prices (because college kids have no money), and therefore don’t have budgets for oddball new ideas. In 15 years, none of these startups worked, even though arguably most of the “problems” existed.\\nYou might think a large company will definitely allocate budget for a known problem, but here again the answer is often in the negative. Budgets are applied to the top few most-important problems of the year; if this is a problem, but not a top one, it won’t get attention. Large companies have to allocate more than money—they have compliance teams who have to approve, they compare multiple vendors, they run pilot programs, and all of this won’t be set in motion unless it’s a top problem.\\nLarge companies have internal teams that are already tasked with the problem, which might means there’s no additional budget for outside solutions. Those teams often fight against outside tools that are seen as making their jobs obsolete, or at least converts them into vendor-managers instead of innovators. You want to target companies who outsource this particular problem to outside vendors.\\nOnce you get over the hurdle of there being a budget at all, is the budget large enough? I’m always shocked how little people will pay for productivity applications like to-do lists and note-taking. These are applications you might use dozens of times per day, as much as email. The slightest increase in efficiency or even simple delight will have a massive impact on the customer’s life, every day. And yet people complain that the Pro version of Bear App9 is a whopping $15/year, or that Remember the Milk is $40/year, or how they’ve been paying €29/year for Evernote for eleven years, but a change to €43 is so devastating that they will completely change to another application that has 1/10th the functionality and no tech support:\\n\\n9\\n My note-taking application of choice, and not just because it’s called “Bear!“\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn general, consumers don’t like paying for stuff, hence the multi-trillion-dollar success of having people “pay” with attention (advertisement) and data (privacy). This is why I think10 self-funded companies in particular should target businesses as customers; unlike consumers, they will spend money to solve problems and to make more money.\\n\\n10\\n This is clearly a personal bias. I can’t wrap my head around the mentality described above, and that’s why I don’t build in and generally don’t invest in B2C—I’m fully aware that I don’t understand the customer!\\nA lot of great ideas, attacking real problems that customers acknowledge and seek solutions for, are in areas where budgets don’t exist, or not often, or are so small that it requires an enormous number of customers to make money (often also in a crowded competitive space), and therefore the company fails.\\nCan you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule. If there are a huge number of potential customers, and if your cost-basis is extremely low11, you can create a strategy targeting a large market at a low price with a simple product12. This works even better if existing products are poor (so you can stand out and make a splash) and expensive (so your low price is itself a differentiator). It’s still risky and difficult, but you could accept that and make decisions consistent with that challenge. But you have to really want that path, and increase the “10M” number, since you’ll need a lot more customers to make ends meet.\\n\\n11\\n e.g. no direct customer service, no substantial infrastructure costs, a route to market that costs almost nothing to acquire a customer, the ability to build and maintain the application with very little design or engineering or product outside of the founders, switching costs are low so you don’t have to do a lot of work or spend a lot of money to get a customer off another product and on-boarded onto your product\\n12\\n When a product will be widely used with little-to-no customer service, it must be simple or it won’t scale.\\nLiquid: Are they willing and able to buy right now? \\n\\n“Oh yeah, we spend $100,000/year on this. But our contract isn’t up for renewal for another 15 months.”\\n“We just implemented a version of this in Workday. I’d rather use your product actually, but it’s just part of Workday and the HR team likes that everything is integrated.”\\n“This is way better than our current system, but we’ve invested a lot integrating with seven other systems, plus a few custom things some engineering teams did, so we can’t really consider switching away at this point.”\\n“That looks like great software for weddings. I’ll let you know when I get married again! Haha!”\\n\\nWhen the customer is already paying to solve the problem, or actively comparing options to solve the problem, you still run into the barrier of whether they have the organizational will to buy from you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis can be for legal reasons, like being locked into a long-term contract or government fiat. This can be for convenience, as in the Workday example which at WP Engine caused us to cancel several other SaaS products because “now it’s all in one system, which we’re paying for anyway, so this is simpler and safer to manage.” This can be because of other forms of lock-in, like difficulty in extracting and moving existing data, having to retrain thousands of employees, or having to re-implement a variety of cross-systems integrations that people rely on for their workflows, data, reports, and governance.\\nNotice that all these forces have nothing to do with your product or its price. They are so powerful, they overwhelm a product that is solving the problem the best, at the best price. That’s why they cannot be ignored, and why founders are surprised when their genuinely-great product in the definitely-extant market where customer are definitely paying for solutions, is still too difficult to sell.\\nOn the bright side, this is a prompt for your strategy. How will your strategy create these sorts of “lock-ins” that will prevent your competitors from kicking you out of your customers?\\nA final way that customers might not be able to buy right now, is when the product is needed at a specific moment in time, but not before or after that moment. Websites for events and occasions are an example, as are tools that solve temporary problems like sophisticated code profilers or load-testing tools. Because Smart Bear13 was in the developer tools market, I know a number of founders of products in the latter two spaces; all of them struggled to maintain even small companies, exactly because people didn’t proactively need the product (i.e. “Don’t have the problem”), but then suddenly did (i.e. “Willing to buy, but only right now”), and then didn’t any more (i.e. “No longer willing to buy”).\\n\\n13\\n My company before WP Engine and the namesake of this website.\\nCan you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule. If there’s a legal contract, you can offer to pay the penalty for them breaking their contract (so long as that isn’t so expensive that you can never be profitable). If it’s hard to migrate, you can offer to do the migration as a service, perhaps even for free (this is common in WP Engine’s market). If you’re fighting the all-in-one enterprise systems like Workday, you can focus instead on a target market that cannot afford Workday and sees Workday as overly complex and cold, so that Workday isn’t even a competitor. If timing is important, you might offer a way to buy that is cheap or even free while not using it, so you’re “right there as soon as you need us again.” But you have to really have answers for these challenges, and be ready to walk that path.\\nEager: Do they want to buy from you, specifically? \\n\\n“It seems like it would work for us, but it looks like you’ve only been in business for a year?”\\n“It definitely worked fine during the trial, but we’re expecting to grow 100x and we’re not confident that you’ll be able to handle it.”\\n“For the features we need, [competitor] looks the same to us, and they’re cheaper.”\\n“I like how you do X, but [competitor] does Y and Z, which we really like, so we’re going with them.”\\n“Our policy requires that all vendors are SOC 2-compliant and provide a security audit trail API, so you did not meet our basic requirements.”\\n\\nEven in a real market, with customers spending real money, in a purchasing process right now, you haven’t yet won. There are other options, ranging from direct competitors to indirect alternatives. They will buy, but will they buy from you?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first hurdle is trust: Do they trust not only that the product works, but that your company will be around for many years to come, that you will maintain a high pace of development, that you won’t have security issues, that your customer service will truly help them when inevitable problems arise, and that you can scale as the customer’s needs scale?\\nThe second hurdle is differentiation. This doesn’t just mean “you have something unique.” You might have a feature that no one else has, but if only 10% of the market cares about that feature, that’s not enough. Worse, your competitor will have some feature you don’t have, and what if 30% of the market cares about that one? How to do this? See this companion article on leverage.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nA special difficulty comes when the product over-serves a large segment of the market. This means that, for example, you have ten features, but most of the market really cares about three of them. You might have all sorts of differentiation in the latter seven, but that won’t sway most people. Picking something simpler or cheaper is the rational choice, even though your “feature comparison matrix” shows that you’re a much more complete solution.\\nA sales team can combat both of these challenges. The job isn’t just to schedule calls, cajole potential customers into action, and press for the close; the job also to build trust in your organization and talk around competitive points, positioning so that the customer wants to buy from the mixed bag of plusses-and-minuses that every product contains.\\nThe best way to overcome these challenges are the “Love” and “Utility” types of willingness-to-pay.\\nCan you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule. Trust can be side-stepped by building a type of product that doesn’t require much trust14. Or trust can be built by mitigation, for example open-source means the customer can shift to another vendor or take over the code base in a worst-case scenario. Differentiation is harder. Sometimes you’re competing on price, which isn’t ideal for the bottom-line or for the quality of customer, but can work very well. In a large market, differentiation can come from specializing in a niche. In a small market, you might not have many viable competitors, lessening the importance of differentiation. A company mission that is “bigger than all of us” can also be a distinguishing reason to buy15, although typically more for consumer products where that’s an allowable purchase-criterium. Still, it difficult to survive when you’re no different from more mature, feature-rich, stable, innovative alternatives.\\n\\n14\\n “Security” isn’t a concern if the data in your app isn’t private, such as a social media management tool. “Uptime” isn’t a concern if the product is run locally or the service isn’t time-critical. “Company maturity” isn’t a concern if it’s a tool for individual use; in fact it can be an advantage for a new startup to sell to freelancers or other people who want to support other startups.\\n15\\n People buy windbreakers from Patagonia that are undifferentiated from other outdoor apparel vendors, because Patagonia is well-known for spending hundreds of millions of dollars on conservation and sustainability, and for treating their employees well.\\nEnduring: Will they still be paying (or paying-it-forward) a year from now? \\nI cannot count the number of indie developers who grow to $15k MRR and start slowing down because their cancellation rate is 7%. Many don’t think this is a problem; many of the rest believe that 5% would be a success. It’s not.\\nFinancials and SaaS metrics aren’t even the primary reason why this is fatal. The problem is that the customers don’t want the product. 5%/mo cancellation means only half the customers will still be customers a year from now, which means you’re not building a sustainable business.\\nThe reasons can vary. Perhaps they needed the product temporarily; they might have loved it, but “the problem” disappears. More often, the product didn’t work well enough—insufficient features, too many bugs, didn’t integrate with some other system, too expensive for the end result, turns out the problem is not important enough.\\nThe financial reality is illuminating too. The challenge is that top-line growth is linear for many companies, and quadratic (not exponential) even with hyper-growth companies. But cancellation is exponential—that’s why it’s measured as a percent of the current customer base. Exponentials grow faster than lines or quadratics, therefore cancellation “catches up” faster than you can add new customers. Growth fades, and finally ceases, as one customer cancels for every new customer who signs up.\\nWith $15k MRR, adding $2k/mo of new customers—a healthy 15% per month growth rate—a 7% cancellation rate means already half of that growth is negated by customers leaving. The company barely got started and already its growth is being decimated. At that rate, only one year later, having grown to about $27k MRR, the company has stopped growing completely16, despite spending time and money on marketing and sales. Don’t forget—those new customers cost money to attract, sell, and on-board with tech support, but all the value of that expense is negated by an equal number of customers walking out the door.\\n\\n16\\n Growth stops because the $2k of new customers arriving in a month are negated by $27k × 7% ≈ $2k customers cancelling in that same month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharting this scenario using the SaaS Plateau Forecaster from Summit.\\n\\n\\nYou certainly aren’t required to have a goal of “grow forever17,” but capping growth because customers don’t really value your product, is not a healthy business no matter what your end goal is.\\n\\n17\\n But especially if you do have the goal of becoming a scale-up Unicorn, it is impossible to do that without low churn. As just one example, Gainsight CEO Nick Mehta recently pointed out why “This stall will happen to all companies eventually,” explaining that launching a second product was their solution.\\nThis example was for a recurring-revenue business, but the same principle is true for one-time revenue businesses. One-time revenue businesses still require repeat revenue, in two ways:\\n\\nCustomers buying again.\\nHappy customers telling other people to become customers.\\n\\nBoth of these require that customers are happy with the product. This reinforces the point that the most important problem is that the customer isn’t satisfied, regardless of business model.\\nCan you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule. Shopify is a fantastically successful business with a 8% cancellation rate—only 34% of new customers stick around for one year. They’re successful anyway because (a) the ones that do stay tend to grow forever and super-linearly, (b) the market is enormous and still growing fast, so they won’t run out of new customers anytime soon, and (c) customers cancel because their own business didn’t succeed, not because Shopify’s product is problematic. If the problem really is the product, I don’t believe there is an exception. The product has to be work well for some segment of the market. The rest can be mitigated if other factors of the market, strategy, and business model can overcome this massive weakness with even-more-massive advantages.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nEvaluating startup viability \\nThis path of “problem” to “business model” is not the only factor that determines success. There are still questions like whether you can reach customers, get their attention in the noisy Internet and competitive space, can you do that cost-effectively, are company costs too high, do you have the skills, can you hire for skills, do you have enough time and money to do it, and so on.\\nStill, we can evaluate the viability of this path with the following model. We’ll use Fermi Estimation to avoid the analysis-paralysis of deep research and arguing over details.\\nSome people have already started using this to think through their businesses, like Sam Bhagwat, co-founder of Gatsby, thinking through his next startup. There’s also some online calculators if you like that sort of thing.\\nAnswer with regard to a specific target market, which means a specific type of buyer solving a specific problem with a product that has made specific trade-offs, at a specific price.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCriteria\\nScore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlausible  Number of potential customers (consumers or businesses) who actually have the problem\\nPower-of-ten only  1k, 10k, 100k, 1M, 10M, 100M, 1B\\n\\n\\nSelf-Aware  Willing to solve the problem\\n0.01: Few agree or care  0.1\\xa0: Thought-leaders care and evangelize  0.5\\xa0: It’s an industry standard-practice  1.0\\xa0: Almost impossible to find someone who doesn’t care\\n\\n\\nLucrative  Annual allocated budget\\nPower-of-ten only, of net-revenue18  $1, $10, $100, $1k, $10k, $100k, $1M\\n\\n\\nLiquid  Frequency of purchase decision\\n0.01: Every few years  0.1\\xa0: An annual decision  1.0\\xa0: Always in the market, easy to switch\\n\\n\\nEager (identity)  Attitude towards your company\\n0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0: They cannot buy from you  0.1\\xa0: Structural challenges  0.5\\xa0: Indifferent; no red flags  1.0\\xa0: Mission-level emotional desire to select you\\n\\n\\nEager (comparative)  Competitive differentiation\\n0.1\\xa0: No material differentiation  0.5\\xa0: Some features are so good, some people will buy just for that  1.0\\xa0: One-of-a-kind solution that has no viable alternative\\n\\n\\nEnduring  Will they still be here a year from now?\\n0.01: One-off purchase without loyalty  0.1\\xa0: One-off purchase, but happy customers will buy again and tell their friends  0.5\\xa0: Recurring-revenue from a recurring-problem  1.0\\xa0: Strong lock-in from fiat, integrations, or being the system-of-record for a business-critical system\\n\\n\\nNormalize  Normalize the score so that 1 is the threshold for an indie startup, 2 or more for a scale-up.19\\nDivide by 625,000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow you multiply. Why multiply? Because this is a series of “ands”—there needs to be customers with the problem and they have budget and they are buying today and so on. The effects compound.\\n\\n18\\n “Net-revenue” means your revenue after subtracting pass-through costs. For example, an eCommerce platform might process a $100 purchase on behalf of its customer, keeping $10 for itself as payment; that is net-revenue of $10. Pass-through costs do not include cost-of-goods-sold, i.e. you should not subtract out the marketing and sales costs to acquire the customer, nor customer support, nor infrastructure costs for SaaS products. Those are important for profitability, but in this exercise we are focused only on top-line revenue, not on the efficiency of your operations.\\n19\\n Justification: Using the figures earlier in the article, you could be successful with 10M consumers at $10/mo, or 100k businesses at $1000/mo (e.g. dentist practice-management), so consider the threshold of those numbers combined to be 100M. Taking the middle value of all other questions—neither a deal-breaker nor a strong advantage—you end up with 100M\\xa0×\\xa00.5\\xa0×\\xa00.1\\xa0×\\xa00.5\\xa0×\\xa00.5\\xa0×\\xa00.5\\xa0=\\xa0625k. Arguably you should have some strong advantages, but also some of these values will be on the low side, so this is a reasonable Fermi-style acceptance threshold.\\nThis is dangerously close to a silly quiz or rubric, so we have to be careful to use the final score as guidance rather than precise analysis. Still, different choices of target market, target customer, and product trade-offs can result in dramatically different results.\\nAs usual, having to think through the answers and trade-offs is most of the value of the exercise, even more than the final score.\\nA few examples \\nStill, let’s try it, using WP Engine20 as the example. Note how our research is simplistic, but because we only have to be accurate to a power of ten, the answers are easy anyway21:\\n\\n20\\n WP Engine is the largest platform for WordPress-based websites among the top ten million websites in the world. Therefore, we’ll take the market as “businesses using WordPress.“\\n21\\n For example, our figures for the first row are just page-one Google search results, but even if the figures are off by 50%, certainly the true answer must be far larger than 10M and far smaller than 1000M, hence 100M is the easy choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCriteria\\nScore\\nJustification\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlausible  Number of businesses who have the problem\\n100M\\nThere are 334M businesses in the world, 71% of which have a website. 43% of websites are WordPress.\\n\\n\\nSelf-Aware  Willing to solve the problem\\n0.1\\nWhile everyone using WordPress definitionally hosts it somewhere, and industry practitioners often use a specialist vendor, most target customers don’t care enough to do more than the bare minimum.\\n\\n\\nLucrative  Annual allocated budget\\n$100\\nDifficult to say over such a large market; one could argue that $10 is more accurate because most businesses are small and most don’t buy expensive American things.\\n\\n\\nLiquid  Frequency of purchase decision\\n0.01\\nPeople rarely change their website platform.\\n\\n\\nEager (identity)  Attitude towards your company\\n0.5\\nCould argue that it is 1.0 today because of our leadership position, but ten years ago we were one option among several, all of which were viable for many customers.\\n\\n\\nEager (comparative)  Competitive differentiation\\n0.5\\nWe have many capabilities and features that are either unique or we are the best, but competitors have other advantages, whether in features or price or geography.\\n\\n\\nEnduring  Will they still be here a year from now?\\n1.0\\nToday we easily justify this with our world-class retention metrics across 14 years of customer data, however even early on we saw high retention, and comparables also have high retention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScore = 2,500,000\\xa0/\\xa0625,000\\xa0= 4, so it qualifies as a scale-up, and indeed that’s what happened.\\nLet’s try it again with an indie startup: ConvertKit, a email marketing product competing with giants like Constant Contact and newcomers like Substack, designed to help you grow and then monetize your subscribers. They target creators who want to monetize their newsletters, not “anyone and everyone,” which reduces the target market but increases willingness-to-pay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCriteria\\nScore\\nJustification\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlausible  Number of people who have the problem\\n10M\\nThere are tens of millions of newsletters using competing products.\\n\\n\\nSelf-Aware  Willing to solve the problem\\n1.0\\nThis is well-known as a best-practice, with multiple at-scale companies serving a mature market.\\n\\n\\nLucrative  Annual allocated budget\\n$100\\nCustomers with complex workflows and many thousands of subscribers will pay more, but most customers aren’t in that category, and might pay $9/mo.22\\n\\n\\nLiquid  Frequency of purchase decision\\n0.01\\nCustomers buy newsletter software and then want to just use it, not be switching\\n\\n\\nEager (identity)  Attitude towards your company\\n0.5\\nThe founder was well-known among other indie founders, however in the broader market there’s no reason not to trust them, but no particular mission-driven reason to pick them either.\\n\\n\\nEager (comparative)  Competitive differentiation\\n0.5\\nMost features are similar, but there are interesting things at the margins for routing readers through flows and monetizing content, whereas more generic newsletter products don’t have as many tools for direct monetization.\\n\\n\\nEnduring  Will they still be here a year from now?\\n0.5\\nFor the customers who avail themselves of complex automations, this would be a 1.0; most people will probably use it as a normal newsletter, with a simple follow-up flow that competitors also provide.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n Alternately, you could focus on the customers who pay more; you might then reduce the “number of people who have the problem” to 1M, and the annual budget to $1000. While results in same score, it’s a different product, serving a different market, so this is an important decision.\\nScore = 1,250,000\\xa0/\\xa0625,000\\xa0= 2. This is a good business model, possibly even a scale-up, and indeed ConvertKit grew quickly as a bootstrapped company, and while not a Unicorn, is an order of magnitude larger than most small businesses ever become.\\nFinally, let’s take the case of selling security software to consumers. This is a tough market; there are success stories (e.g. Norton, 1Password, Cloudflare), but it’s hard to find small indie companies who are successful in this area (whereas it’s easy to find successful indie WordPress hosting companies):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCriteria\\nScore\\nJustification\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlausible  Number of people who have the problem\\n1B\\nThere are ~5B people online today, who might have online security concerns\\n\\n\\nSelf-Aware  Willing to solve the problem\\n0.01\\nHave you bought special security software for an online project? Almost no consumer does.\\n\\n\\nLucrative  Annual allocated budget\\n$10\\nConsumers don’t pay much for things, and globally consumers spend far less on average than Americans on equivalent online goods; arguably this should even be $1.\\n\\n\\nLiquid  Frequency of purchase decision\\n0.01\\nConsumers are rarely in the market.\\n\\n\\nEager (identity)  Attitude towards your company\\n0.5\\nUnclear without specifics, we’ll be generous and assume you can earn trust despite being an unknown brand.\\n\\n\\nEager (comparative)  Competitive differentiation\\n0.1\\nConsumer-grade security products are undifferentiated.\\n\\n\\nEnduring  Will they still be here a year from now?\\n0.5\\nConsumers cancel at higher rates than businesses, but at a low price this could be something that is easy to maintain; industry data would be helpful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScore = 25,000\\xa0/\\xa0625,000\\xa0= 0.04. This is not a good business model.\\nBut there’s hope…\\nWhat to do with a negative answer \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don’t have to give up just yet.\\nWhat if the security company targets high-net-worth individuals instead of “everyone?” The “number of people” would fall to 1,000,000, but willingness to solve the problem might rise to 1.0, and budget certainly rises to $100 if not $1000. The orders of magnitude can change dramatically, which might reveal a workable model.\\nWhat if the security company targets mid-sized businesses? The number of organizations is smaller than the number of consumers (but is still large), willingness to solve is very high (they have security policies and fear of the downside of a security incident), budgets are substantial, and so on.\\nIn general, targeting a niche often results in a better business model, because although it reduces the number of target customers, it can increase several other numbers. This is very often the right answer whether your goal is to build a small, profitable, sustainable business (in which you stay in that niche forever) or a large multi-billion-dollar enterprise (in which the niche is your way to get started, and you expand the target market over time).\\n\\n\\n\\nI’d rather be wrong than do something wrong.\\n—Larry Ellison\\n\\n\\nOr, finally, your business idea might simply not be viable. That is a sad and tough reality to face, but it’s better to figure that out early, so you can spend your time finding a new idea.\\nI hope this framework helps you build a winning strategy!\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nFurther Reading \\n\\nFive ways to build a $100M business, the classic by Christoph Janz that uses five animals to show the different orders-of-magnitude of price versus size of company and quantity of those companies.

These prompts actually work. They could even lead to a unique business model.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do you come up with fresh, transformative ideas?\\n“Brainstorming” is hard—staring at a blank whiteboard, wondering whether someone could make a real-life “dark mode” whiteboard, then realizing that’s what a blackboard is, only dustier.\\nOr the modern version, seventeen pointers flying around a Miro board, zooming to 2000% to read that auto-scaled-down text in each standard-sized virtual sticky-note.\\nWe’re blinded by our daily work: No forest, all trees. It’s too easy to glom onto an idea that’s been knocking around for year, its importance undeservedly increased by the familiarity of repetition. It’s hard to think past the last seven customer interviews or support tickets or sales calls. Those are great for generating tactical ideas that fuel our roadmaps, but they are tiny incrementalisms that cement us into tiny thinking.\\nThe following prompts jostle you out of tiny thinking. Each stretches some dimension of reality to an extreme. So extreme that it is nearly nonsense. But dramatically different perspectives can reveal distinctly new ideas. An idea that would be a 60% solution in an extreme hypothetical case, could be a 2x or even a 10x idea in reality.\\nSometimes the extreme is surprisingly appropriate. Unique business models emerge when at least one dimension is so extreme that it defies critics and competitors to even conceive of its possibility1. A fantastic idea fulfilling the right extreme can be a company’s entire strategy, unlocking a long-term competitive moat.\\n\\n1\\n All of these were considered impossible barriers or business models, until a company did it anyway and won because of it: Zappos’ free shoe returns 364 days after purchase, Robinhood’s $0 trading fees, Amazon’s free delivery with Prime, Netflix’s mail-order DVD rental, open-source software companies charging for something that’s 100% free and 0% secret intellectual property (now hundreds of billions of dollars in combined public-company value), AirBnB, Uber, and Lyft trusting that strangers will trust strangers in the intimate spaces of cars and homes.\\nIt’s worth a try.\\n10x prices \\nIf you were forced to increase your prices by 10x, what would you have to do to justify it?\\nWhat sort of brand looks and feels like something that expensive? What positioning would you take? How would the design of both the website and the product need to change?\\nWhat subset of your market would you have to target? Do they have different problems that need solving, or different needs? Would they consider the high price a positive, because it fulfills a need to be seen as someone who is successful, or because they feel “buying from the best” lowers the risk of their decision? What would you need to do for them to be able to display that badge? What sort of relationship would you want to cultivate with each customer? How would your business model change?\\nWhat expensive services might you need to supply? Human support? Infrastructure? Is it possible for those costs to be “only” 2x or 3x more than today, so that the net impact is massive profitability?\\nOften early startups charge too little, and established companies struggle to charge more to existing customers. Thinking about what could justify a massive hike, you might be able to do some of those things and justify at least 2x.\\nNo customers \\nIf all our customers vanished, and we had to earn our growth and brand from scratch, what would we do?\\nHow would we distinguish ourselves with a unique compelling message, as a fresh competitor in our market? What would we put on our home page? Would we use a different pricing model to compete better? Would our brand need to change to align with the message?\\nWould we throw out some features that take a lot of work but not many people actually use (since there’s no pesky customers hanging on to the expectation of the old features)? Would we build some new feature that would make us more competitive? Would we change our infrastructure or architecture or UX dramatically because of what we now know, since we’re not ladened with existing customers?\\nOften we don’t make important changes because we’ve gotten complacent with our marketing, or we never got around to having a truly compelling unique positioning statement, or we don’t want to incur the penalty of big changes on our customer base, even if it means we’re doing the wrong thing today from a competitive standpoint, and the wrong thing for the future. We don’t want to make even 5% of our customers mad, even if it would be better for the other 95%. There will be 10x more customers in the future than there are now, but only if we build for them, today.\\nNo tech support \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you were never allowed to provide tech support, in any form, what would have to change?\\nHow would on-boarding need to be improved, to the point where customers would self-serve and be happy doing it? This might be the hardest step, because the customer is least-familiar with your product, and least-motivated to power through barriers to their success. And setup stuff often has to be done only once, so you might not learn how to improve those things from existing customers.\\nWhere would the product need provide the user with more control, since they can’t ask Support to do it for them? What information requires better visibility, since they can’t ask Support to look it up for them? What actions would need to be become more intuitive, because they can’t ask Support how to use functionality that they know “is in here somewhere?”\\nSelf-service isn’t just better for your costs and scaling, it also makes customers happier and more loyal. Therefore, dramatically improving self-service is often profitable for both the top- and bottom-line.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\nMaximize fun \\nWhat would be the most fun thing to build?\\nIt has to be something that makes our product better, not a random technology or unrelated market. Aside from that constraint, it can be anything—building a feature you just think would be cool for customers to use, developing a technology that would be fun to work on (that happens to deliver a feature customers want), refactoring infrastructure or architecture using some interesting modern technology that would also improve something like cost-efficiency, scalability, testability, or maintainability.\\nWhat if you held a one-week hackathon and actually tried to build one of those things?\\nWhen we work on things that are fun, we work better and harder, yet are happy to do it. Therefore, biasing towards fun is also biasing towards productivity and long-term fulfillment, which is practical and logical, not merely indulgent as it first appears. Ultimately, work still needs to advance the strategy while improving something substantial for the customer or the team, but typical prioritization under-appreciates the power of fun.\\nComplete rip-off \\nIf our biggest competitor copied every feature we have, how would we still win?\\nIs the answer inside our product, in something other than the utility of the features? What is that, and how could we make more of that, so we’re differentiated even in the face of a copy-cat? Is it ease of use, ease of sharing, pleasure of great design? Is it building the next unique feature so quickly that no competitor can catch up (since in this hypothetical they’re just copying us rather than being insightful on their own), and if so, what is the killer next feature that would leap-frog us from a customer’s perspective?\\nIf the answer is outside of our product, where is it? A higher purpose or brand-promise that our customers buy into, aside from the product? Is that because we are good at communicating how we make the world better, or because our customers are “rooting for David against Goliath,” or how our culture is special, or because our brand is distinctive (even if just “it’s the best” or “it’s the biggest”), or because our customers trust us, maybe because of our customer service, or because of how we handle situations that go poorly, or because we “give back” in forms like open-source or community-building or significant philanthropy?\\nAll your good ideas will be copied; it’s just a question of when. Competing only on features results in bullet-point battles; this is the weakest way to win sales. Creating bigger and more emotional distinction is a powerful way to win, and breaks us of the habit of believing that incremental product updates will dramatically increase differentiation, or growth.\\nNo time \\nWhat if we are forced to ship a full, completed MVP (or actually, SLC) new feature, in just two weeks, that would delight and surprise some fraction of our customers.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time.\\n—Leonard Bernstein\\n\\n\\nEvery bit of complexity has to be stripped out—we can add it back later. Scope has to be reduced to a minimum, which reduces how many people can use it on day one, but increases how much we’ll learn on day one.\\nCan we stub out an API, implementing it manually for now? Can we hook up some 3rd-party system, implementing something more efficient later? Can we skip documentation and internal support training and perfect error handling, not forever, but just long enough to see how people like this new functionality?\\nA 1000-page book can be summarized in a 40-page Cliff’s Notes. The key lessons of Cliff’s Notes can be summarized in a 1-page blog post. The main theme and one unique perspective of the book can be summarized in one sentence. It can always be smaller, if we trade off detail, or precision, or completeness.\\nHackathons prove that we can code really cool things in a short time, when we want to, and if we make certain trade-offs. It’s not fully finished, not polished, not ready to scale, but it’s something substantial and far more “agile” than teams normally are. If you feel like you’ve lapsed into a waterfall with two-week report-outs, this might be the shake-up everyone needs.\\nFlipped business model \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat if you were forced to charge customers in a completely different manner? The product isn’t free, but somehow you have to justify value (and costs) differently. If you’re usage-based, you’re forced to charge a flat monthly rate; if monthly with tiers, you’re forced to measure and charge daily with some formula.\\nHow would you have to change how you position the value you deliver? Would you have different kinds of customers due to prices effectively being much higher or lower, and how would that affect brand, messaging, marketing, or sales?\\nHow would costs have to change, so that the vast majority of customers were still profitable? Would software architectures need to change? Would marketing or sales structures change? Is tech support suddenly much more or much less possible?\\nAre there features which you’d need to build (e.g. so customers could control their costs), or features you’d now be able to supply (e.g. because customers would now see the utility in it, or would be happy to pay more because of it)? Would you create features which caused higher prices, but in concert with additional value, so that customers would be happy to grow with you?\\nBusiness models force you into certain frames of thinking about how to monetize value that you create, and how costs need to scale with sales and infrastructure. The general idea for any company is to generate far more value than it charges for, so customers are genuinely better off in the exchange, and are happy to be long-term customers. Shaking up the business model shakes up the value/cost equation; sometimes a different business model is actually better for everyone.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\nNo website \\nIf you were not allowed to have a website, how would you still grow your business?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCould you grow by word-of-mouth? Does the product help people do that proactively?\\nCould you create advocacy, as in channel partners or ambassadors? Could your social media be so good, someone would sign up for the product without needing to know more?\\nCould your product be marketing? Could you cheat, where your “website” is inside the product, where potential customers are caught up learning more and trying things in the moment, so that they become users before they realize what’s happening?\\nYour advocates are already using your product, yet so often we leave “getting more customers” to the marketing department, rather than realizing the product is already a platform for growth. Truly viral products know this already (e.g. you can’t use a chat service unless you invite other people to the chat service), but non-viral products can still create growth machines from inside the product. What if “in-product marketing” is more impactful on growth than any useful feature?\\nNo meetings \\nWhat if you made your most introverted teammates’ dreams come true: No more synchronous meetings, ever again?\\nWhat if you had to on-board new employees without meetings? Or operate the software, deploy the software, find where things are located? What systems would need to exist, and what materials would need to go in there? What format would allow you to update that easily?\\nWhat if you had to make decisions without meetings—the process as well as the result of that decision? Deciding what to build, prioritizing big or small things, brainstorming new things? Is it possible that brainstormed ideas could be even better without meetings (because people aren’t being influenced by other people, ahead of having their own thoughts) or that decisions could be even stronger without meetings (because people have the time and space to think, to research, to try things out, thus more completely exploring the solution space?).\\nHow would you create social ties and inside jokes and 1:1 as well as group relationships, if you’re never in the same space at the same time?\\nMeetings are still the best way to accomplish certain things: Social bonding, deep discussions where ideas rapidly ricochet off each other, decisions where it’s important to “look in everyone’s eyes” to get the final agreement, and more. But one of the most common complaints in any company is “too many meetings,” or at least, “too many useless/bad/wasteful/inefficient/boring meetings.” Besides the usual admonitions about meeting hygiene, a bigger question is whether your systems and processes can not only prevent them, but increase utility beyond that. For example, how much faster could a new team member get up-to-speed if they could read “the why” behind the last 20 major decisions?\\nNo customer contact \\nIf we could never talk to our customers again, how would we figure out what to build?\\nCould you measure their behavior so well that you could quickly measure whether any change was positive or negative, so at least you could iterate your way to a better product? Are there clear signs of value or happiness that you could use like marketers use conversion with A/B testing?\\nCould you be even faster at testing new ideas? Could a feature start out as just a button that says “coming soon” or asks “why did you want this” or “what did you expect to happen” or “get emailed when we make this feature,” so you could directly measure what people are likely to use, before you invest in building it?\\nWhat could you analyze online, in what customers or competitors or observers are saying, that would inform your strategy or even product roadmap? Could you do better than just copying what others are doing? Could you analyze what people are saying about us or competitors online, understanding that the loudest voices aren’t a random sample of the population, but still might have something useful to tell us, even when they’re not being constructive about it?\\nSometimes you interview customers and come away with the wrong feature ideas anyway. Sometimes you ask them whether they’d use something, and they say yes, and they even meant it, but after spending five months building it, they don’t actually use it. Stretching your ability to get empirical signal helps you avoid those issues, and might even create breakthrough ideas, or avoid ideas that seem great, but aren’t.\\nCost is no object \\nWhat if it didn’t matter how unprofitable you were?\\nMaybe prices stay the same but you can spend 10x or 100x more, even if that’s wildly unprofitable. Or maybe the product is free, too. How would you spend the money? How much value could you deliver, if you thought of the product as an exercise in philanthropy?\\nIt could be infrastructure or software, but what about the personal touch? What would a dedicated, personal concierge do? If software could do just 30% of that job, but at 1/100th of the cost, that could be a good feature.\\nIt can be surprisingly difficult to convert money to real customer or business value, even when money is free. If there is a way, it might lead to a new pricing tier, leveraging that idea but adding back a sustainable business model.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\nSociopathic CEO \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat if you could change anything, regardless of what anyone thinks or feels?\\nTerminating an entire product line would shake the organization, and possibly incur layoffs in multiple departments. But what if it’s the best thing to do, despite that? What if you allowed yourself to explore what that would be like? What if it turns out you can make that pivot by reorganization rather than layoffs, and now company is executing a much better strategy?\\nPivoting the entire company could break the organization, destroy trust in leadership, cause people to leave, and piss off investors. But what if that’s exactly the transformation required to fix the strategy? Is there anything that might actually be worth such a move?\\nYou never want to contemplate catastrophic actions like layoffs, whole-company pivots, terminating an entire product line, and for good reason—the consequences are dire, arguably even inhumane. At the same time, that aversion prevents you from thinking certain thoughts. You should at least be able to explore the thoughts. The very best ideas should not be avoided only because they are hard.\\nMortal wound \\nWhat externality has the potential to kill the entire company?\\nIs there a company X, which released product Y, at price Z, that would reduce your new sales to a trickle, and would mean half your customers leave within a year? Can you think of a security breech so significant, most of the customer base leaves within a year? How could the economy change, in which no one would buy your software?\\nNow, is there something you could do to mitigate that effect? Or something that pivots the company such that it is no longer a threat?\\nI ran this exercise at WP Engine and we came up with 35 existential threats; it’s not wise to worry about all of them, and try to negate all of them. Sometimes, however, you find an idea which is wise to do anyway, that also shores up your defenses. Or, one threat sticks out as being so likely that it warrants acting ahead of time.\\nPhilanthropist \\nWhat if our only goal were to create the most good in the world, personally for our customers?\\nIgnore how to make money; assume that works itself out. But still talking about our customers (don’t argue about which world-wide causes are “most important”). How could we make their lives better, not because our product has greater utility, but because our product is doing something important. How could we help them achieve their ultimate goals rather than just “use features?”\\nIf our customers are small businesses, could we help them grow and thrive? If our customers are writers, could we help them improve their craft? If our customers are performers, could we get them more attention? If our customers are enormous companies, could we help them use their greater scale and wealth to create more good in the world? If our customers come from all walks of life, could we increase the access and equity in their reach and power?\\nThere’s already strong evidence that having a mission bigger than yourself, more than metrics, creates more—and more loyal—customers and fulfilled employees both. Recent surveys of Gen Z show that they care about whether a company does good in the world just as much as they care about compensation. So, even aside from the ethical reasons, there are “self-interested capitalist” reasons to create more good, not just more MRR.\\nOnly one thing this year \\nWhat if you could only ship one thing this year?\\nWhat single initiative would make the most difference? What’s so impactful that it would actually be OK if we shipped nothing else? You get the entire year, so there’s time for a release, and fixes, and enhancements, but it has to be only one topic.\\nWhat would generate the most revenue? What would be so differentiated in the market, and so desirable, that customers still buy and stay even with your lack of any other substantial product changes? What would be so exciting that customers would stay even if other things are missing or have on-going bugs?\\nWhen you look back over years of a business, often the whole trajectory comes down to 1-2 big decisions per year. A critical product launch, a key decision to enter a market for expansion or exit one market to focus on a healthier one, a key hire, a competitive insight. It’s difficult to know in the moment which will be seminal, but thinking this way forces you to think of only the absolutely most impactful ideas, which are probably the ones you should be focused on regardless.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dangerous man is the one who has only one idea, because then he’ll fight and die for it. The way real science goes is that you come up with lots of ideas, and most of them will be wrong.\\n—Francis Crick\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/extreme-questions/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExtreme brainstorming questions to trigger new, better ideas\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)10x pricesNo customersNo tech supportMaximize funComplete rip-offNo timeFlipped business modelNo websiteNo meetingsNo customer contactCost is no objectSociopathic CEOMortal woundPhilanthropistOnly one thing this year\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Here are those things.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt doesn’t seem possible for a startup to beat an incumbent.\\nAn incumbent has everything: money, brand, customers, a sales team, marketing that generates thousands of leads every month, product and engineering teams that constantly ship. They mine their big existing customer base for ideas, and then build exactly the right features, and then charge for it. Their 24/7 support team provides faster and better service than someone working in their pajamas at home. They don’t have to build the basics or ask Twitter how to manage international sales tax. They can just focus on innovating.\\nOf course if you’ve ever worked at a big company, you know that while those things seem true, it often doesn’t feel like it. Big companies are rarely well-oiled innovation machines, and it certainly doesn’t feel like you’re constantly outpacing the competition.\\nWhen we analyze how incumbents are vulnerable, we uncover opportunities that startups can exploit to win, where there’s often nothing the incumbent can do about it, despite their advantages:\\n\\nTaking risks that cannot be quantified\\nAddressing a profitable niche\\nDoing delightful, valuable things that don’t scale\\nUnsurpassed customer service\\nLeveraging new technology\\nHaving an opinionated personality\\nDoing things that aren’t zero-sum\\nBeing worse-but-acceptable in most dimensions\\nBeing low-cost against a profit center\\n\\nThe pattern: Every big-company advantage creates exploitable weakness \\nThe reason big companies don’t function as well as described above is that things at scale are super-linearly more difficult.\\nIt’s an advantage to have 100,000 customers when you’re figuring out what the next feature should be, or when you’re launching a second product, or when you get free growth from word-of-mouth.\\nBut it’s a disadvantage to have a lot of customers when you want to innovate with your product, because no customer wakes up in the morning and says: Gee, I hope the software I’m accustomed to dramatically changes today. Customers don’t want to learn new UIs. Customers have workflows that you have to accommodate. Old technology that powers those 100,000 customers doesn’t support the latest technology. You have to update documentation and videos and the people in support and sales who need to be retrained. Even a simple change can be difficult and expensive, and certainly low-ROI.\\nBesides “scale,” a big company must accommodate things startups can ignore.\\nThere’s the legal department, for example. A startup does all kinds of illegal things. Most startups do not pay taxes properly, sometimes not at all, especially in other countries. Startups don’t adhere to all the Acceptable Use Policies of all the products they use. Startups don’t have a security team who vets vendors before sending them sensitive data, or vets libraries before they’re integrated into the code base, causing all of their supposed “secret intellectual property” to become open-source.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a result, the startup not only moves more quickly—which is how most people characterize it—but they can completely skip things that a larger company cannot. So Uber decided to just do illegal things in order to grow. An incumbent taxi company obeys the law, so they lose. You could say that that’s not fair. You could say that’s what regulation ought to prevent. But the reality is that startups often ignore the law, and that can be an edge.\\nThe way a startup wins, is to do things that incumbents cannot or will not do.\\nSo, let’s detail those things.\\nTake risks that cannot be quantified \\nThe way a larger company decides to take a risk, such as launching a new product line or entering a new market, is by creating a detailed analysis of the opportunity, and a cost estimate. Then the decision is:\\n\\nIs this is a good ROI? (potential-revenue divided by costs)\\nDo we have conviction that the risk of failure is low?\\n\\nHow can a startup exploit this decision process?\\nStarting with decision (1), the analysis is typically wrong. There are studies everywhere—and your own experience, if you’ve worked at a large company—showing that most development projects are significantly late and over-budget, and also that the outcome is typically worse than expected. Both sides of the ROI fraction are worse1.\\n\\n1\\n I cover exactly what to do about this in an article about how to do ROI analyses correctly.\\nSo, whichever projects appear through traditional cost-benefit analysis to be low-ROI, are unlikely for an incumbent to do, even though there’s a good chance that (a) they’re rejecting genuinely good ideas and (b) they’re accepting weaker, more straightforward ideas, only because those more readily lend themselves to ROI analysis. A startup who selects “apparently” low-ROI projects, will probably have no competition from incumbents.\\nWith decision (2), big companies don’t like to take big risks even when the outcome might be large. The fear of failure is an order of magnitude more motivating than the desire to innovate or even the greed of success. One reason is that the core business is probably going well, and you “don’t want to mess that up.” Another reason is that no one wants to be the one who proposed, fought for, and then presided over a multi-million-dollar failure. Another reason is that none of us really knows what a “big risk” is anyway, because even experts can’t predict what will happen, and we don’t know how to talk about risks or measure risks, even in retrospect.\\nAt a big company, it’s safer to say “let’s gather more data” and “let’s wait for consensus” than it is to take a risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut innovative things are often high risk or unknown risk2. Therefore, a startup can pick things which are risky, or where the risk is impossible to ascertain, but where the potential upside is high, and incumbents are unlikely to follow.\\n\\n2\\n “High risk” means we know number that is the probability of success, and it is low. “Uncertainty” is unknown risk, meaning we don’t know what the number is at all. Though different, they have the same result in this context: It’s too scary to take the chance.\\nIndeed, this is also what I recommend for work-planning in general in selecting and prioritizing Rocks versus Pebbles, where the “big Rocks” that move the needle should be selected on the basis of potential outcome rather than ROI, whereas the Pebbles should indeed be based on ROI.\\nStartups can do it, while incumbents are almost always too fearful.\\nThat’s OK, the incumbent can buy you later at 10x revenue.\\nAddress a niche \\nAn incumbent wanting to expand into a new market or launch a new product line, must apply a significant amount of money and people—a large investment, even for them. What kind of return do they need on that investment?\\nThe answer is: It has to materially affect their growth rate.\\nThe rule of thumb is it should increase their overall revenue by at least 10%; some people call this “the materiality threshold.” However, that number goes up as the (perceived) risk or (actual) investment increases. For an incumbent with hundreds of millions in revenue, that means the product line must have a good chance of making $50-$100 million, or they won’t even try (nor should they).\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven our size, we only see a few good things [to invest in]. If we were smaller, then we’d see lots of good things.\\n—Warren Buffett.\\n\\n\\nAnother financial metric that creates a materiality threshold is a certain ratio on the Profit & Loss statement.\\nA software company at scale spends around 20% of their revenue on R&D, which includes Product, Engineering and Design. A fully loaded team, including salaries, taxes, software, hardware, training, management, travel, office space, and so on, can cost upwards of $2 million a year3. If that cost is supposed to be 20% of revenue, the team needs to generate at least $10 million in annual revenue, which means the product they’re working on must do that, even if the product is a small add-on or the team owns a subset of a larger product.\\n\\n3\\n Obviously this varies by geography, employment laws, tax laws, and the size and composition of the team; this estimate assumes a team of eight engineers, a product manager, a designer, and a manager, in the US, and rounding-off for rhetorical simplicity.\\nOf course, a small startup doesn’t see it that way. A team of two founders and one employee isn’t thinking “We have to make $10 million a year, otherwise it’s a failure!” This means the startup can focus on a niche that doesn’t need to generate $10 million; it could generate $1 million.\\nThe startup can focus on a niche and ICP that a big company cannot afford to target, either because that niche wouldn’t hit the overall revenue materiality threshold, or wouldn’t hit the one-team P&L threshold.\\nWith that focus, the startup has no direct competition from an incumbent. In fact, the larger the incumbent, the less the startup has to worry about competition.\\nFeels good.\\nDo things that don’t scale \\nWP Engine was the first in our market to support LetsEncrypt4. We knew nearly all of our customers would want it. We wanted to promote it heavily, but we were already deep into scale, with 100,000 customers who could potentially use it on day one.\\n\\n4\\n If you’re unfamiliar with this web technology, don’t worry—the details aren’t important to the story. Suffice to say: It was a desirable capability, and is now ubiquitous.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTherefore, it had to be scalable before we released it. That means breaking down the components into queues, in case one step in the process was faster than another, or in case one failed and had to be repaired before the system could make progress. And we had to monitor those queues, and send alerts to humans if it stayed broken for too long. And we had to run at-scale tests to make sure it worked when there were 1000 requests simultaneously with random failures. And we had to train hundreds of folks in tech support on the questions we anticipated, and train hundreds of folks in sales on how to leverage this to make sales, and work with marketing on how to message it. And we had to make sure it had close to zero bugs, because if thousands of people start using it, and 10% ran into a bug, we’d crush our support team, and hundreds of people would take to Twitter to complain.\\nWe were correct to invest many months of time in all these areas; on the first day, thousands of people did start using it, tens of thousands in the first month, and indeed some components did break, and lots of people asked questions in tech support. And people praised us on Twitter as a result.\\nThe good news about a large customer base, is that you can have 1000 users on day one and 10,000 on day 30. In this case we gave it away for free, but in general an incumbent can be generating $1M ARR or even $10M in short order. A startup cannot do that.\\nBut a startup can launch something in a few weeks and iterate. We had to be heads-down for most of a year. And so another startup opportunity emerges: A startup doesn’t have to operate at scale.\\nYou might say: A larger company can still make an alpha version of a product, show it to a few dozen customers, and iterate from there. Indeed, we also do that; it’s a wise process. However, what a larger company is not willing to do is take the next couple of years just to get to $1M ARR and then take a couple more years to get to $5M and then take a couple more years to get to $20M. That’s just way too long to get the “material” amount of revenue and does not leverage their at-scale assets.\\nBut the ramp I just mentioned is ideal for a startup; in fact, that is a highly successful growth rate. It allows time for the product to settle in and slowly get to the point where it is scaling. This is a reasonable, fun, and plausible path. No one knows you exist; that’s bad for sales, but good for iterating without harming your reputation.\\nTherefore, if a certain product idea is naturally very easy to scale from day one, that’s easy for an incumbent to copy. But if the product is naturally difficult to scale from day one, that’s ideal for a startup.\\nUnsurpassed customer service from founders & engineers \\nI personally handled support tickets every day at WP Engine until we had around 35 people; this is typical for a customer-oriented founder. There’s no better way to understand how people interact with the product than to talk to them about when it’s going wrong or not meeting their expectations. You get feature ideas, you understand how to streamline the product and how to increase retention.\\nCustomers are impressed by the quality of support and the range of problems you can solve. They won’t get that from a company with a thousand tech support reps. Some startups aren’t interested in providing great support, but those that do are naturally and even effortlessly orders of magnitude better than a large incumbent. It’s a competitive advantage available to everyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if those benefits to both customers and product development aren’t enough, it also fosters real love and loyalty from customers. That love translates to forgiveness when you do have problems; see the mountain of supportive tweets when a small-but-lovable company has a big outage or security issue. It also translates into word-of-mouth advocacy, as customers naturally reciprocate, and thus great support results in inexpensive growth. Love is the best form of “willingness to pay.”\\nWhich incumbents cannot compete with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a startup scales, it loses this advantage. I distinctly remember each time in the past 14 years at WP Engine that a new competitor would brag about their amazing tech support. While WP Engine continues to objectively5 have world-class support, it’s not the same as personal attention from the founder of the company!\\n\\n5\\n Won a dozen Stevie Awards, and maintains 98% CSAT.\\nYou could decide to never to grow that large, optimizing for profit and efficiency rather than revenue and scale, and make Support a permanent competitive advantage.\\nNo matter which future you pick, this is still a great way to get started.\\nLeverage new technology \\nWhen a technology is new, the risk of using it is high.\\nMaybe it won’t be supported in five years. Maybe you won’t be able to hire dozens of engineers who are familiar with it. Maybe6 it will have a big security problem. Maybe it works well for the “Hello, World!” case, but doesn’t work at scale. Maybe it’s efficient for one developer but too difficult to coordinate with thirty. These are all reasons why incumbents are absolutely correct in avoiding new technology.\\n\\n6\\n In fact, certainly it will have many security issues… the question is whether they will be identified and addressed.\\nBut a startup doesn’t have these concerns. Not because the big company is wrong, but because the constraints are different. The thing that will kill the startup is not going to be the tech stack; it’s going to be that it’s too hard to find customers, or they don’t have a budget for this problem, or it’s too hard to compete, or you run out of money, or any of the other things needed to get to Product/Market Fit.\\nAnd new technology often creates a competitive advantage. New technology makes certain things efficient, or enables things which previously were impossible, as in the current case of AI.\\nThe startup is taking a risk on that technology. If you’re banking on a new open source project, and it doesn’t take off, you might have a product built on a platform that is no longer supported, and that’s bad even if you’re a small startup.\\nHowever, what is the worst case, assuming the startup isn’t already dead by then? It’s that, five years from now, you’ve built a sustainable company, and now you have to redo your platform using different technology. That does really suck for you. You might have to pause new features for a year to make the transition, and engineers, product managers, and sales reps alike will hate that. But if this penalty “buys” you a successful company, then it was worth it.\\nHave an opinionated personality \\nIt is rare for a large company to express a personality.\\nThere are many reasons for this. They want to address a large and therefore diverse market to sustain their revenue and growth; by speaking to everyone, they speak to no one in particular. They have an established brand, which creates trust, which is one of the reasons they win sales, embodied in the now-outdated phrase “No one ever got fired for hiring IBM.” So the language on the homepage and inside the product needs to reinforce this trust, which means being impersonal but solid.\\nAnother reason is that customer communication is spread over hundreds or thousands of people, from Support to Sales to Marketing to Product to Design. There isn’t such a thing as a genuine, human personality and style that a thousand people share and express identically. Whereas everyone can conform to generic but professional language.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut a startup doesn’t have these constraints. Indeed, the founder often has a strong personality, with specific ideas of what’s good and bad and how things should be done and how to express it. That’s at least partially why they started a company in the first place.\\nSome potential customers will be attracted to that personality and some will be repulsed. But that’s true of anything that is wonderful and different and powerful in this world.\\nWhen a large company tries inject personality, it often comes off as contrived, not genuine. Whereas with a startup, it feels genuine because it is genuine.\\nSome customers only want to buy from the market leader. That’s rational, and if that’s a primary deciding factor, there’s little a startup can do about it, no matter what their home page says. Therefore, the startup should ignore that segment and focus on customers who want to buy from a plucky upstart that has something to say.\\nDo things that aren’t zero-sum \\nSome things in business are a zero-sum game.\\nIn a zero-sum game, when one player wins, another player necessarily loses. Poker is an example: When one player wins chips, other players lose exactly that number of chips. Blackjack is a counter-example: Players at a table individually win or lose, unaffected by other players; no player loses chips when another player wins.\\nMarketing gives us examples of each. Zero-sum marketing channels arise when there’s a power law or where there is exclusivity. Examples:\\n\\nSEO (The top positions generate more traffic than all other positions combined)\\nAdWords (The top positions generate more traffic than all other positions combined)\\nAffiliates (The top few affiliates generate more leads than all others combined)\\nRetail shelf space (Limited surface area)\\nExclusive distribution deals (The zero-sum game is created by agreement)\\nGovernment fiat (A vendor can be written into law)\\n\\nConversely, there are channels that are non-zero-sum, and more to the point, where even a well-funded, strongly-entrenched incumbent cannot prevent others from winning:\\n\\nSocial media (anyone can create a great social presence)\\nNewsletters (anyone can create great content marketing)\\nCollaborative promotions (both players more money than they would have)\\nEcosystems like Salesforce and the Apple Store (all players make more money)\\nConsumers who buy multiple products (e.g. 3D animators often use multiple tools)\\n\\nMarket dynamics can also create either type of game. Stagnant or shrinking markets are zero-sum; without new customers entering the arena, winning one customer means a competitor cannot have that revenue. In growing markets there’s a steady stream of new dollars from new customers, so many competitors can grow. (This is yet another reason why startups should target growing markets, whether the goal is to build a small, profitable company or a unicorn.)\\nIncumbents are stronger in zero-sum games, because they can apply money and specialized expertise. They can even over-spend, because their scaled business model can absorb a low ROI activity, intentionally losing money in order to stop competitors from using that channel. This doesn’t mean startups should never play zero-sum games, but they are more difficult, and sometimes impossible.\\nBut incumbents cannot stop startups from winning non-zero-sum games, so that’s where a startup should invest.\\nBe worse but acceptable in most dimensions \\nNo one wants their website to go down.\\nIt’s surprising how hard it is to keep a website up for an entire year. For example, “99.9% uptime” might sound excellent, but that equates to 44 minutes of downtime every month! If our company WP Engine had even close to that much downtime, customers would revolt, and rightfully so. Yet, most hosting companies7 promise only 99.9%−99.95% uptime.\\n\\n7\\n Including the major cloud providers, managed WordPress platforms like WP Engine, and specialized providers like Toasttab for restaurants\\nThe reason is that it’s very hard to push the number higher. It takes an order of magnitude more direct spend, software development, and processes to get to 99.99%, to say nothing of the proverbial “5-9’s” that industrial operations sometimes target. Every little rare, strange, unpredictable thing will knock you out of compliance; it’s expensive and difficult to solve all those cases. And yet, 99.99% just doesn’t look that different from 99.95% on the pricing page.\\nIncumbents, however, often do have to invest in optimizing these expensive dimensions like. One reason is that at scale, rare things become common; at scale you have have no choice. Another reason is that it can win sales in some segments of the market; at WP Engine we have enterprise customers who have internal policies demanding 99.99% uptime, so we win against competitors with lesser guarantees.\\nStartups don’t have the rare-at-scale problem, and they can choose their target market such that customers don’t have extreme demands8, and therefore startups can win while incumbents labor.\\n\\n8\\n Indeed, startups should actively avoid those customers. A startup with a new product definitionally won’t satisfy customers with myriad, difficult demands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore examples where incumbents have to care, but startups don’t:\\n\\nSecurity\\nWP Engine spends tens of millions of dollars a year on security, ranging from internal teams to corporate policies to annual employee training to SOC and ISO compliance to software reviews to vendor security reviews. For us, security is one of our main selling points, so this is important both for scale, brand, de-risking, and because it’s what customers pay us for. But that’s not true of most products, and most customers don’t demand it.\\nQuality\\nIf the entire product is low quality in every dimension, that’s just a bad product. I doubt anyone is excited to build that, not even as an SLC (MVP). For example, uptime is important for WP Engine, but for a SaaS product that is used only during normal working hours, targeted at a certain geography where “working hours” is a well-defined timeframe, having even an hour of downtime in the middle of the night doesn’t affect customers at all. A large, global company doesn’t have that luxury.\\nScalability\\nIf a product will never need to handle “big data,” then the product can be built with all sorts of simplifying assumptions9 that make development faster, safer, even more enjoyable. The UX can be simpler if the users have basic needs, as opposed to nested security groups driven by an external LDAP service.\\n\\n\\n9\\n PostgreSQL instead of BigQuery, SQLLite instead of PostgreSQL, Python instead of Erlang, reading into memory instead of streaming, batch jobs instead of assemblages of queues and auto-scale groups, standard algorithms rather than distributed computation, normal debuggers instead of distributed logs, off-the-shelf libraries and vendors instead of bespoke solutions\\n\\nCompliance\\nLarge companies accumulate internal policies. These are for good reasons, like ensuring that not everyone has access to all data (especially customer data), ensuring that IT teams are capable of managing and upgrading thousands of devices, safeguarding ownership of their intellectual property, and enabling sales to large enterprises and governments in various verticals who impose policies on their vendors. This is one of the reasons they can get multi-million-dollar three-year contracts and the start can’t. But it also severely hampers what they can do, or at what speed they can do it, or at what cost, and therefore at what customer-facing price.\\nLegal\\nWe covered this earlier. While I would never advocate for startups to do illegal things on purpose, it’s a simple fact that startups often (unknowingly) don’t comply with all laws. It doesn’t affect their sales; in fact, it might increase it.\\n\\nMost customers don’t care about most things. This is great news for startups, who can select one or two dimensions to care about, and the ideal customer segment who also cares mostly about those specific things, and win that segment while incumbents chase complexity in all quarters.\\nWhile incumbents have to charge more to cover the costs of multi-dimensional excellence at scale, a startup can charge less for a product that’s objectively “worse” along many dimensions, and thus the startup can win on price and still be profitable.\\nStartups can be worse, but unique, and better where it counts.\\nBe low-cost against the profit-center \\nAn incumbent cannot change its business model.\\nThe assets that give the incumbent its advantage are also static constraints. The brand is entrenched in consumers’ minds. The software relies on platforms and languages and libraries that cannot be changed without a massive rewrite which infamously almost always fails. The business model of marketing, sales, service, and profits is set; a company with the costs of a global sales team, the white-glove on-boarding team, the expensive infrastructure, the vendor costs, and shareholder expectations that profits will only increase, cannot drop prices.\\nTherefore, an incumbent cannot compete with a startup which is “a ’lite’ version for 1/10th the price.”\\nThis is a softer way of restating Disruption Theory10, in which incumbents see the startup coming but, rather than compete directly, reposition themselves to focus on their best, most profitable customer segments, thereby allowing the startup to thrive.\\n\\n10\\n Famously explained in Innovator’s Dilemma, the theory is more specific than what I’m saying here, involving new technology that is “worse, but cheaper, but in some ways better,” where the incumbent seems to act rationally but ends up being completely disrupted.\\nMore specifically: Whatever generates the most profits for the incumbent, is the thing they are least able to change.\\nYou have to be careful, because incumbents will spend a lot of money and attention defending their profit centers from attack. But price won’t be how they defend. That defense means you should leverage other topics from this article; for example an incumbent can decide to spend “too much” money on AdWords to make that a worse channel for you, but they cannot stop you from having a great content marketing strategy.\\n\\nIncumbents are strong in most ways, but they are vulnerable.\\nThe only mistake is for a startup to go head-to-head with an incumbent where the incumbent is strong.\\nAttack where you are strong, and they are weak.\\nThis is how to build a winning strategy.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/startup-beats-incumbent/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow startups beat incumbents\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)The pattern: Every big-company advantage creates exploitable weaknessTake risks that cannot be quantifiedAddress a nicheDo things that don’t scaleUnsurpassed customer service from founders & engineersLeverage new technologyHave an opinionated personalityDo things that aren’t zero-sumBe worse but acceptable in most dimensionsBe low-cost against the profit-center\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Exploration leads to a framework I’ve used for years for myself and the people around me. I hope it helps you too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany blogs, resulting in book deals, resulting in speaking careers, have been forged by taking a swing at a basic human question:\\n\\nWhat creates a fulfilling existence?\\n\\nManagers desperately ask, forced by the Great Resignation to acknowledge that people are more mobile than expected when sufficiently (un)motivated1. Enlightened leaders ask proactively, because intrinsically-motivated people do great work that is just as fulfilling for themselves as it is productive for the company—capitalism on its best day. Outwardly-impenetrable leaders ask it of themselves to conquer burn-out or to decide what to do with the balance of life that follows the societal definition of “success.”\\n\\n1\\n Your best talent are volunteers—they can always walk across the (now virtual) street for more money, because they’re worth it, and because their resume has been incrementally improved by the experience at your company. You may protest that the grass isn’t greener over there, but rather their feelings arise from the modern malaise instigated by COVID-imposed isolation from genuine relationships and the vile so-called online “relationships” fueled by toxic politics. You might even be right, but it’s too late.\\nWhat follows is my original framework I used to answer this question for myself ten years ago when I made the decision to step aside as CEO of the (now unicorn) company I founded. I still use it myself and recommend it to others.\\nFirst, some of the best prior art on the topic.\\nPink’s Motivation: Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose \\nDaniel Pink famously surmised2 that “carrots and sticks” are poor motivators for most people. Worse, they’re demonstrably counter-productive in common real-world scenarios. Instead of external motivators, blatantly designed for the benefit of the organization rather than the individual, people prefer—people deserve—to be driven by internal motivation, aligned with genuine personal fulfillment.\\n\\n2\\n in his book, though you might prefer to watch his extremely popular TED talk\\nMy subjective experience confirms this science-backed insight. The best people don’t have to settle for anything less than personal fulfillment at work, as evidenced by the Great Resignation. And anyway it results in an organization that we are all proud to build.\\nPink suggests that internal motivation arises under three conditions:\\n\\nAutonomy\\nPeople are fulfilled when they decide what to do and how to do it. Counter-examples include micro-management, inflexible working conditions, and one-way command-and-control structures. Positive examples include self-managed scrum teams, work-from-anywhere-and-whenever schedules, and agreeing on the goals of the final product rather than dictating the details of what that product is and how it must be created.\\nMastery\\nGreat people want the opportunity to do great work. They want to be around other people who are doing the same. Experts enjoy deploying their expertise; novices with vim and aptitude enjoy learning and growing.\\nPurpose\\nAs the janitor famously answered in 1962 when president Kennedy asked him what he did for NASA, “I’m helping put a man on the moon.” Everyone—not just Gen Z—wants to be a part of something bigger than themselves. That could be a noble cause, or something more incremental but tangible, like genuinely helping another human being in their own endeavors, as one might do in a world-class customer service organization.\\n\\nOther work agrees with and extends these ideas3. However, I believe that to leap from Pink’s original question—What motivates people?—to my question—What is fulfilling?—at least one vital component is missing: Joy.\\n\\n3\\n For example, Self-Determination Theory asserts that motivation arises from “autonomy, competence, and relatedness”—essentially the same thing.\\n生き甲斐: A reason to be alive \\nFor thousands of years the Japanese have revered those who devote their lives to the mastering of a craft, having “craftsman spirit” 職人気質 (shokunin kishitsu). The samurai and the flower-arranger hold equal value, the chef and the janitor hold equal prestige, when each are whole-hearted in their endeavors. Furthermore, world-class skill is only half of the meaning of being a shokunin; you must also play a mindful and intentional role in bettering the community.\\nIt is not only “Mastery” but also “Purpose.” The Japanese have venerated 2/3rds of Pink’s trifecta for millennia.\\nAn equally ancient concept, that received a direct name in the 1960s, is 生き甲斐 (ikigai)—a motivating force that gives someone a reason for living:\\n\\n… ikigai … usually means the feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment that follows when people pursue their passions. Activities that generate the feeling of ikigai are not forced on an individual; they are perceived as being spontaneous and undertaken willingly, and thus are personal and depend on a person’s inner self. (Wikipedia)\\n\\nThis brings color to the idea of intrinsic motivation as well as that of extrinsic purpose. Furthermore, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this is a reason to go on living at all:\\n\\nNational Geographic reporter Dan Buettner suggested ikigai may be one of the reasons for the longevity of the people of Okinawa. According to Buettner, Okinawans have less desire to retire, as people continue to do their favourite job as long as they remain healthy. “Moai”, the close-knit friend group, is considered an important reason for the people of Okinawa to live long. In 2016, [Héctor García and Francesc Miralles published] a book based on this concept: Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life. (Wikipedia)\\n\\nWe need purpose, whether it’s the Silicon Valley notion of “changing the world” or to be a great-grand-parent. To be useful, to be needed, even to be wanted, one person to another, is already a higher purpose.\\nOne person at a time, can be all it takes, as in this serendipitous Slack exchange I had with WPGraphQL founder Jason Bahl:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(reprinted with permission)\\n\\n\\nA “higher purpose” might elicit an eye-roll from the skeptic, but it turns out to be useful even if you’re a cold-blooded, mercenary, even authoritarian-style leader.\\nSinek’s Fanaticism: Start with why \\nSimon Sinek wanted to know why some organizations produce fanatics. Not just customers and employees, not just people who like and buy the products, but people who personally identify with the company, incorporating the company’s brand into their personal brand. When competitors build something objectively better, they don’t switch, because for them it’s not just about the features and the price. They’d work for that company if they could, and many do. As a result, employee turnover is low and productivity is high. Therefore every aspect of the business is stronger. How does this arise?\\nSinek sums up the answer: These companies Start with “Why.” Meaning: These organizations have clear, simple, compelling raison d’être, a reason for being, something they stand for, something they would never contravene with their actions, even if it hurts sales or profitability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt could be a “higher purpose,” like Patagonia’s incontrovertible mission to save the Earth4, or SpaceX’s mission to make humanity a multi-planetary species, or the Gates Foundation project to save millions of lives by eradicating malaria.\\n\\n4\\n Beyond the obvious—sustainable practices, an outdoor-worshipping culture—they have a formal company policy to bail employees out of jail if arrested while protesting peacefully.\\nBut it doesn’t have to be grandiose or holy to be motivating. Sinek frequently returns to the example of Apple’s “Think Different” campaign; this taps the personal brand of those who are (or want to be seen as) independently-minded, creative, creators, iconoclasts, and artists, including artists embedded in fields like software development and engineering. Or Salesforce with its “1-1-1” or WP Engine with its “Engine for Good\"—thoughtful, systematic ways of giving back to the communities they are a part of (without pretending to single-handedly “change the world”). Or Rackspace with their “fanatical support,” transforming the traditional status of Customer Service from a begrudged cost-center hell-bent on cost-reduction, elevating it instead into the honor of serving others, and a critical product differentiator in a market that is otherwise commoditized.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen people are financially invested, they want a return. When people are emotionally invested, they want to contribute.\\n—Simon Sinek\\n\\n\\nAll of these companies were created by and are still run by Gen-X-and-older. So, wanting a higher purpose isn’t just “a Gen Z thing,” though clearly younger generations do, on average, talk about this more, and more conscientiously. In any case, the freshest talent and the future leaders of the world are Gen Z, so even a leader unsympathetic to “causes” should realize that having a higher purpose is more useful than not having one.\\nThis confirms and clarifies the “Purpose” component of the Pink Trifecta. Sinek approached it from an analysis of fanaticism and loyalty to organizations, and arrived at the same place.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nCohen’s Circles & Traps: Joy, Skill, Need \\nIt is possible to be empowered to work how you want (Autonomy), to be leveraging your skills and expertise (Mastery), and to be proud of your role in a cause (Purpose / Why), and yet still dislike every day of your existence. More than contentment (ikigai), you need Joy.\\nNot only is this possible, it is common. There’s the classic example of the startup founder who wakes up six years into the journey, realizing she’s been surreptitiously brought to a boil, burned out, dreading each day, drinking too much “to turn my brain off so I can sleep” but actually because she’s deeply unhappy:\\n\\nEach morning for the past couple months, my first thought has been “What could today be like if I didn’t work here?” I drift off into exploring what it would be like to work at WalMart, or the construction site outside, or as a bagger at a grocery store. It seems so stress free. This morning, I locked myself in the bathroom with the shower running (don’t want wife to know) and cried my eyes out. I haven’t cried in many years. It felt great, but only for an hour.\\n—Anonymous founder\\n\\nEight years ago I created my own framework for understanding how I could avoid this burn-out trap at WP Engine5, especially when making decisions that are contrary to ego. The ego says “Being the CEO is the best.” Silicon Valley says “The founder being the CEO is the Only Way6.” So it’s hard to convince the ego to let go of being the CEO, as I did at WP Engine, even if being the CEO creates unhappiness.\\n\\n5\\n Whereas I did burn out at my previous company Smart Bear. Even selling the business didn’t immediately fix the problem, although it was the beginning of the answer.\\n6\\n Typically citing Apple, Facebook, and Amazon while ignoring counter-examples like Google, LinkedIn, and Intel, although there do exist thoughtful arguments that embrace those exceptions.\\nHere’s the insight: Not only do you need all three of the following components, but any two alone create a specific trap:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSomeday I’ll make a Venn diagram where “the middle” isn’t the answer, but today is not that day.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoy\\nYou love doing it. When you do it all day, you forget to eat and pee. At the end of a long day of doing it, you still want to do it.\\nSkill\\nYou’re great at it. Your work is so good, even you are proud of it. It stands out, and others notice. Those who don’t understand how much effort you expended say: “You’re a natural.”\\nNeed\\nThe company needs it done. It’s a top-three priority. Doing it well means a critical part of your strategy will succeed. Not doing it is crippling.\\n\\nHaving any two without the third creates a well-defined yet common trap. It’s instructive to understand the traps, because it can feel good to be in the trap:\\n\\nTrap: Joy + Skill − Need = Useless Flow\\nAt the intersection of Joy and Skill is “being in the zone,” a.k.a. Flow7. Wonderful! Unless you’re working on something the company doesn’t need done. Being in flow is intoxicating, and does “recharge the batteries,” but it’s unproductive. Continuing the example of the burned-out founder living in this trap, there’s no one willing or able to tell you to your face that you’re not contributing to what the company needs, so you stay in your happy place. A classic example is the technical founder writing code instead of making sales, fixing the website, handling the accounting, or hiring the next great team member.\\n\\n\\n7\\n Flow is when a person is fully immersed in an activity for an extended period of time. Time passes unwittingly, performance is at maximum, and it is universally described as pleasurable.\\n\\nTrap: Joy + Need − Skill = Indulgent Failure\\nThe company needs to begin advertising. You’ve never done AdWords before, but you always wanted to try it, and anyway it’d be fun to learn something new. You might hire someone to do it later, but not now, because how do you hire and manage someone else without understanding the job yourself? So you make the AdWords campaigns. And since you’re unskilled at both marketing and AdWords, you waste three months. You might even erroneously conclude “AdWords doesn’t work” because that’s an easier conclusion than “I don’t know what I’m doing.” If the company needed advertising so badly, you did a disservice to the company by indulging your desire to “play with it,” because now months have passed without accomplishing what needed to be done. You tell yourself that now you can hire that person, because three months of flailing somehow makes you an “expert.” As founder, no one will contradict you, so you indulge, and the company falls that much further behind.\\nTrap: Skill + Need − Joy = Burn-out\\nThis is classic burn-out. When you do the work all day, you feel drained and exhausted rather than energized (as you would if it were Flow = Skill + Joy). You do the work, because the company needs it done. You do the work, because you are undeniably great at it. Even though you hate doing it, you’d rather take it on yourself rather than foist it on others, whether because you want to “protect them from the drudgery8,” or because you believe they can’t do as good a job as you can, or because you can’t afford to hire someone. Because you create great results that the company needs, it doesn’t look like a problem—not to you, nor your team. But because you dislike it, you grow to resent it, and eventually you can’t face it, and you’re finished.\\n\\n\\n8\\n Most people don’t want the boss always doing all the drudgery. They wouldn’t mind helping. In fact, that can be great for bonding. In fact, some people actually like the thing you hate, and you’re preventing them from being happier.\\nI created and used this framework nearly a decade ago, to recognize the wisdom of changing roles from the CEO of the company I founded (WP Engine) to the CTO, so that both our new CEO and I could operate in the center of our Venn diagrams. The thousands of people who have since worked at our company concur that this was a fantastic decision, both personally for the two of us, and for the success of the business, which is now a unicorn and an iconic landmark in Austin, Texas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCo-winning E&Y’s Central Texas Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2017 with our inimitable CEO Heather Brunner, who I frequently refer to as “the founder who joined three years in.” Copying how Reid Hoffman describes Jeff Weiner at LinkedIn, it is neither an exaggeration nor unearned appellation.\\n\\n\\nThis framework is not a replacement of Pink’s model; it is compatible. It adds the missing “Joy” component, while reinforcing “Mastery” with the label of “Skill.” It lacks “Autonomy,” however, perhaps because I created it with the founder in mind—a person who definitionally possesses autonomy, even to their detriment. “Need” is more tactical than “Purpose,” really about being useful.\\nTherefore, my recommendation is to identify that higher purpose, as described by “Start with Why” or ikigai, and fulfill your own part in that purpose at the center of the three circles.\\nWhen we intentionally create a work environment where others have a chance at fulfillment, we’re already improving the world substantially. When we care enough about others to find out what fulfills them, we can help that materialize. When we’re closer to our own center of fulfillment, we can better serve others.\\nEasier said than done, but do it you must.\\nHow to find your circles of “Joy” and “Skill” \\n“Know thyself9” is easier said than done, so here’s some help in actually executing on this framework.\\n\\n9\\n Inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, independently opined by many people throughout history, Thales gave this as the answer to the question: What is the most difficult thing? When asked what is the easiest thing, he answered: To give advice. Which is what I do in these articles. The truth hurts!\\nHere’s some prompts to get you started:\\n\\nEven when I was a kid, I would ______, and I still find myself drawn to it.\\nLately I find that I love it whenever ______, which would surprise my ten-years-ago self.\\nIf I could go back in time, I would tell myself to worry less about ______ and more about ______.\\nWhen I’m on an extended vacation, I get itchy to ______; I just can’t help it.\\nMy parents/friends always laugh when I start talking about ______ because I get so excited I can’t stop talking about it.\\nMy parents always said I would be a ______ because even when I was three years old…\\nWhenever I ______, I get lost in the work, and feel energized (not exhausted!) when the work ends.\\nIf I could go (back to) college, I would get a degree in ______.\\nThe last project I really enjoyed, and would totally go back and keep working on, was ______.\\nI was surprised how much my peers praised my work when I ______; maybe I’m better at that than I thought.\\nRecently I was totally immersed, engaged, excited, and happy while doing ______.\\nI asked a few people who know me, and who I trust to be thoughtful and observant, and they said my special strengths are ______.\\n\\nJust as useful are anti-examples. Sometimes it’s easier to avoid something you hate, then to construct a situation where you’re constantly doing something you love:\\n\\nI have an intense dread of any meeting where we ______.\\nThe last time I had to ______, I did an embarrassingly minimal job, because I couldn’t bring myself to do better.\\nIf my job starts requiring me to ______ with even 10% of my time, I would at least think about changing jobs.\\nWhen I’m faced with ______ I physically feel the “pit of my stomach” falling.\\nWhen I’m faced with ______ I procrastinate even to do chores that I dislike and would normally avoid.\\nIf I’m being honest, although I would really love to be great at ______, the fact is I’m just never going to be good at it.\\nWhenever I ______ all day long, I know I do great work, but I’m absolutely exhausted; the rest of the night will be vegging out of the sofa with mindless entertainment.\\nI know I’m supposed to like / do ______, but the truth is I can never get excited about it.\\n\\nYou should be honest, even if you think “society” wouldn’t like your answers. There’s nothing wrong with the drive to make money, or to become famous, or to prove a point.\\n\\nDesire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on the grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc., etc. It is humbug to pretend this is not a motive, and a strong one. Writers share this characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers, soldiers, successful businessmen—in short, with the whole top crust of humanity.\\n—George Orwell, Why I Write\\n\\nThe best scenario is when you are doing your calling. As Tim Ferris describes it, when anyone asks him whether they ought to write a book:\\n\\nIf the rewards are 1/4 of what you think they will be, and it takes 2x longer than you think it will take, is it still a no-brainer to do it? Not just “good” but a “no-brainer,” like you almost have to do it?\\n\\nA final note on “Skill”—there is the skill you already have, but there is also the skill you aspire to have, that you’re excited to develop.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am always doing that which I can not do, in order that I may learn how to do it.\\n—Vincent van Gogh\\n\\n\\nThis is useful to highlight, because learning is often fulfilling. The healthiest work environment is where your existing skills help you succeed at the nominal job description (so you’re operating from a position of strength), and where the job permits or even encourages your learning in the direction you want to develop (incurring the costs of learning, such as work taking longer than it ought to and making avoidable mistakes).\\nI wish you luck on your journey!\\n\\nThank you to Jason Evanish for providing feedback on earlier drafts.\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/fulfillment/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFinding Fulfillment\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Pink’s Motivation: Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose生き甲斐: A reason to be aliveSinek’s Fanaticism: Start with whyCohen’s Circles & Traps: Joy, Skill, NeedHow to find your circles of “Joy” and “Skill”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Does that mean “strategy” is senseless? No, it means you need these techniques to navigate a volatile world.\\n\\nPredicting markets \\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs spend their whole life learning advanced mathematics, building sophisticated models of complex corners of the world, and are financially incentivized to predict the future accurately, because Goldman Sachs makes billions of dollars if they can be 10% more correct than the next firm (who also employs brilliant analysts).\\nSo, how accurately did they predict economic metrics within their area of expertise? They got it very wrong, for 25 years, often not even directionally correct:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nThick blue line is the actual value of the metric; grey lines are quarterly predictions of how the blue line will move, from each starting-point.\\n\\n\\nHere’s another:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut maybe the macro economy is too hard to predict. It is “chaotic,” we are told, in the mathematical sense that small changes in inputs result in large, unpredictable changes in outputs. The “Butterfly Effect.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we create strategies, we’re told to “skate where the puck is going.” That means predicting the future, such as macro economic trends, and the trends of our industry and immediate competitive markets.\\nBut if the smartest, most motivated experts can’t do that, why do we think we can?\\nLet’s try something closer to what corporate strategists must do: Predict the future for products in well-understood industries.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nPredicting sales \\n\\nResearchers at McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, studied the sales forecasts for new drugs made by analysts at brokerage firms. The data included more than 1,700 individual forecasts on 260 drugs over a recent ten-year span. … The average error was large. Almost two-thirds of the estimates missed the peak revenue amount by 40 percent or more. Further, forecasts for follow-on drugs were no better than the first launches within a therapeutic class.\\n—Michael Mauboussin & Dan Callahan in Total Addressable Market, Credit Suisse 2015 (my emphasis)\\n\\nOnce again, highly incentivized, highly trained analysts, within their area of expertise, within a well-understood, highly-regulated industry, mostly get it really wrong, whether predicting sales of a new drug, or predicting sales of a new competitor to an existing drug.\\nMauboussin and Callahan suggest that one way to increase the accuracy of predictions is to “use base rates as a reality check.” That is, use the industry average as the starting point for your prediction.\\nDoes this method work? They illustrate:\\n\\nHere’s an example of how the base rate approach can figure into your judgment of TAM. During a conference call in February 2015, Elon Musk, the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Tesla Motors, suggested the company might be able to achieve a 50 percent compound annual growth rate of sales for the next decade …\\n… The base rate method … simply asks: “What happened to other companies when they were in a comparable position?” Exhibit 12 shows the distribution of 10-year sales growth rates for more than 1,200 instances of companies of a similar size as Tesla is now, measured by sales. The average growth rate, adjusted for inflation, is less than three percent, with a standard deviation below eight percent. Further, no companies achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in excess of 40 percent … We have placed a star at the growth rate Musk mentions.\\n—Michael Mauboussin & Dan Callahan in Total Addressable Market, Credit Suisse 2015 (my emphasis)\\n\\nAs we see from Exhibit 12, Musk’s call is completely outrageous when using the base-rate method:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExhibit 12: 10-year growth rates for companies with $6B-$13B of sales.\\nSource: Michael J. Mauboussin and Dan Callahan, “The Base Rate Book—Sales Growth,” Credit Suisse Global Financial Strategies, May 4, 2015.\\n\\n\\nIt is 2023 as of this writing, so we can evaluate Musk’s call and the base-rate method:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nActual Tesla revenue CAGR since 2015 is 55%—even more than Musk’s 2015 claim.\\n\\n\\nSo, the base-rate method is suspicious, and the analysts are suspicious. Is anything not suspicious?\\nWhen we build strategies, we’re predicting what sorts of products are going to sell, often inside a fast-changing market, selling to customers with fickle desires in an ever-changing competitive landscape. Drugs that address a well-known disease with well-known rates of incidence and trends, with well-known competition, are easy in comparison. Easy, but already almost impossible even by the experts. And using base-rates doesn’t give us much confidence either.\\nSo why do we think we can do it?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDaily Mail, from the year 2000.\\nChoice excerpts: “e-mail [is] far from replacing other forms of communication” // “the future of online shopping is limited” // “teenagers’ use of the Internet has declined … they’ve been through all that and then realized there is more to life in the real world and gone back to it.” // And who generate these nonsense predictions? “Experts from the Virtual Society Project” comprised of “research from 25 universities across Europe and the US.”\\n\\n\\nPredicting winners \\nChess Grandmasters spend far more than 10,000 hours reaching an elite, unbelievable level of skill. They instantly pattern-match board positions against thousands of games they’ve memorized. They have an intuitive sense of how the future might unfold, without actually thinking through every possibility. They understand the relative strength of the best players, because they’ve studied their games for years. So when they guess who is going to win the 85th annual Tata Steel tournament—arguably the most prestigious tournament on the annual circuit—it is more than just “sports betting.” It’s betting by deeply educated experts. How did their predictions go?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nNotice Giri—initially tiny, then growing, then shrinking by round 8, then growing again, then being crushed by Abdusattorov on round 12.\\nGiri won the tournament on round 13.\\n\\n\\nThe “base rate” prediction is that Magnus Carlsen—the world #1 in all three major categories of chess, arguably the best player to have ever lived—should win, and indeed he was given the highest probability of winning before the tournament began, even up to round 4.\\nBut the world doesn’t necessarily unfold around the base-rate. Nordirbek Abdusattorov—an 18-year-old junior player rated more than 100 Elo points lower than Carlsen (an enormous gap)—was given such a small sliver of a chance at the start that it’s hard to even read the number. He lead the tournament standings until the very last game. He also beat Carlsen in round 5.\\nAnd Giri was never given more than a 30% chance; usually 10% or less. He won the entire thing.\\nThe same thing happened during the last FIFA World Cup. Argentina—the eventual winner—was never given much of a chance; even in the quarter-finals the bets were on France:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we build strategies, we’re predicting the competitive market and which products will be winners. Chess and soccer games have a higher variance than companies, but analyzing sales funnels sometimes feels a bit like predicting Tata Steel. How do you build a strategy around this level of unpredictability?\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nPredicting product \\nStewart Butterfield always wanted to make a game. So, in 2002, he did:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGame Neverending: An in-browser multi-player on-line game “with no way to win, nor any definition of success.” (Like some companies I know)\\n\\n\\nIt failed, but it had some interesting features. Alpha testers liked that they could share game objects by dragging them into chat windows. So, the engineers created an online application for real-time chat with image-sharing.\\nStewart Butterfield is the founder of Slack, so you might guess that this “better chat” idea became Slack, but no.\\nThe chat application only worked in real-time—your pictures didn’t stick around when you closed the app. And this was fatal because it turns out people were interested in the sharing part more than the real-time part. So in yet another upheaval they rewrote the Flash application as a regular website, and Flickr was born. By 2008 it had become the largest photo-sharing site in the world with 3 billion photos and 5,000 more uploaded every minute.\\nYahoo bought Flickr for $25M in 2005; Butterfield left three years later. Now that he had money in his pocket, he was free to go back and do what he always wanted to do, which was to make a game. So, in 2009, he did:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a whole story about their dreams of a massively-multi-player experience, with APIs so others would build even more things on top of the game.\\nBut it doesn’t matter, because once again it was a failure, and shut down. But once again there was a piece of the game that people really liked, and once again it was the chat system. Butterfield pivoted the company with a new mission, and a new name that belied the mission: SLACK, the Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.\\nStill not “chat,” but rather a “searchable log of knowledge.” It’s too hard, Butterfield insisted, for corporate denizens to search Google docs, and email, and chat sessions, and intranets, and knowledge bases, and support channels, and sales logs. Slack brings all that content together into a single omni-search, thus solving a knowledge-management problem common to all companies.\\nButterfield was certain that merely “building yet another chat system” was a bad strategy, whereas “transforming communications” was a good strategy:\\n\\nWe are unlikely to be able to sell “a group chat system” very well: there are just not enough people shopping for group chat.\\nThat’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation.\\n—Stewart Butterfield, Slack founder, in 2014\\n\\nOnce again, great theory, great mission, great strategy… and it didn’t work. Slack was, and is, yet another chat system.\\nFortunately for him, Butterfield was also wrong that “just chat” wouldn’t sell very well. Slack was one of the fastest-growing companies in history:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat it is about people not wanting to build chat? WhatsApp has a parallel story. Initially it was just a way to post a public status message, so friends could see what everyone is up to, hence “WhatsApp” (like “What’s Up”). No one cared. Then the iPhone launched push-notifications, so they added a feature to alert you when a friend’s status changed. People started abusing this as a crude form of group-chat. So they added group-chat as a proper feature. The correct strategy was simple: SMS costs money for most people in the world, so a winning product strategy is “SMS, but free.” That strategy worked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we build strategies, we’re predicting how customers will receive our product, how it will solve problems or be delightful. And yet so often the idea we start with isn’t the idea that wins. Even once Slack became “Slack” and not “Glitch,” the strategy was still wrong. How can we ever be right?\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nThe Solution \\nThe Slack and WhatsApp stories of unpredictable success have at least two things in common:\\n\\nThey had a strategy—a philosophy of what would be entertaining or useful, a design sense of what would be delightful, brand new ideas for features and user interactions that people loved. They didn’t just throw random things at the wall.\\nThey went where the customers took them—if not a game, then sharing images; if not another game, then better chat; if not corporate omni-search, then chat with APIs, if not status updates, then free SMS.\\n\\nA strategy is required, even when it’s wrong. \\nA strategy gives you a direction. A direction creates something interesting. Something interesting might be used by zealous early fans, even if it ends up uncovering the answer rather than being the answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Game Neverending wasn’t delightful enough to attract alpha testers, there would never have been a reboot into Flickr; if Glitch didn’t have 150,000 users at its peak, there wouldn’t be the idea for Slack; if Slack didn’t have enormous ambitions, it would not have received VC funding (for the same reason Butterfield himself gave for why “yet another chat” isn’t valuable).\\nA corollary: Making a decision and moving forward is often more effective than extended deliberation about the decision. Deliberation assumes we know how to reason about the future, but even experts aren’t good at that. Making decisions and gaining experience is how to find the right answers, if the organization is introspective enough to also face the truth when it turns out the original strategy is incorrect.\\nDispense with the idea that there is One True Solution to the puzzles, and that the way to get there is to gather enough information. While “iterate fast, learn fast” is good advice, it still doesn’t mean you’re iterating towards the One True Solution. It means you’re taking a path towards something, which will turn out to be an integration between your own creation and the swirling reality outside of you.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore than any other time in history, mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness. The other, to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.\\n—Woody Allen\\n\\n\\nThe customer (behavior) is always (directionally) right. \\nThere is a contradiction in these two points. Point (1) is to have a firm strategy, yet point (2) is to go wherever the customers are, even if that violates (1). If you just do “whatever customers want,” how is that a strategy?\\nThe answer is: Customers are where you discover how to upgrade your strategy. Since you know your initial strategy is wrong, following customers’ lead is how you correct it.\\nWhen a customer loves one feature especially, or asks for adjacent features, those requests themselves are not your new strategy; the intent behind them might be. So “give me push notifications for my status updates” is a feature request, but the reason they want that is to circumvent SMS, and incorporating that idea is the strategy upgrade.\\nPerhaps the most interesting signal is when the customer abuses your product to accomplish something else. The desire for that “something else” is so great, they’re willing to use the wrong tool to get it done. Not only exemplified by WhatsApp users abusing “my status” to be “group chat,” but also in my own experience getting Smart Bear to start growing:\\nOur first product (Code Historian) let you visualize the history of your codebase, which seemed cool to me but few people paid for it:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI realize how old this screenshot looks, but it also means these insights have withstood the test of time.\\n\\n\\nBut people abused it to enable peer review. We were getting feature requests like: “Let me package up what’s on my screen and send it to someone else,” and “Let me write directly on a line of code and send it back.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwenty years later, this is a standard feature of many developer tools, but at the time it was an innovation that fueled a multi-million-dollar bootstrapped company.\\n\\n\\nA new product was born (Code Collaborator) which within a few years represented 97% of the revenue of the company. “Abuse” is a strong, positive signal for customer demand, and worthy of a change in strategy.\\nSo yes, the future is unpredictable. But that doesn’t absolve you from creating a strategy, and it certainly doesn’t mean you should accept that life is a random walk, with no way to bias results in your favor. In fact, sometimes strategies are correct right from the start, like it was with Google, LinkedIn, Amazon, Apple, and my latest company WP Engine1.\\n\\n1\\n Although one reason WP Engine was correct at launch was because I used a system to discover what was important before building it.\\nYou need a strategy, a fixation like Butterfield has for a certain type of game, a galvanizing reason for everyone to act together with a common purpose. And yet the strategy is always under suspicion, always updating, always reacting to unpredictable realities.\\nHow, exactly, do you do this?\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nStrategies that defeat unpredictability \\nWhile it might not be possible to predict the future, it is possible for a strategy to side-step unpredictability through these mechanisms:\\nBuild a moat \\nCovered in this companion article, a “moat” is a long-term, durable competitive advantage. A structural advantage that others cannot disrupt, lasting for years, is resilient to the volatility of your competitive market.\\nHave more than one way to succeed \\nIf multiple things all have to go right for a plan to succeed, it probably won’t succeed. That sort of plan tacitly assumes we can predict the future of many different components; surely a bad bet.\\nThis is why startups are difficult in the first place: We have to have an insight and build a compelling product and be able to reach target customers and do that cost-effectively and at a price customers will accept and be better than the competition for some segment and not lose a key team member early on and not have global economic failure. Like this.\\nA resilient plan is built of “or” not “and:” We could reach customers through social media or paid advertisement or influencer marketing or channel sales. A product that at least could be sold in all those ways is more likely to succeed than a product which can only be sold a single way.\\nOptionality defeats unpredictability:\\n\\nA product that is very low cost to create has many options for pricing, and therefore more likely to find effective pricing.\\nA product in a large, growing market has many niches and personas and channels to potentially target, and therefore it’s more likely you’ll find some combination that works.\\nSome indie developers build multiple small products, then pour their effort into whichever one happens to take off.\\n\\nMore examples are given in Nassim Taleb’s concept of Antifragility. In his words:\\n\\nIf you “have optionality,” you don’t have much need for what is commonly called intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills, and these complicated things that take place in our brain cells. For you don’t have to be right that often. All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself (some acts of omission) and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur.\\n—Nassim Taleb, Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder (2014)\\n\\nLeverage your assets \\n“Strike where you are strong and the enemy is weak” said Sun Tzu 2,500 years ago, echoing into strategy-design from the SWOT of the 1970s to modern agile frameworks like the “Means” in Effectuation.\\nThis is obvious but often forgotten by entrepreneurs who believe they have found lucrative opportunities with amazing product ideas, but which fall outside of their sphere of competency, where the enemy is strong and they are weak. Any venture is likely to fail for many—unpredictable—reasons; the very least you can do, is leverage your capabilities, knowledge, network, (professional) friends, and accumulated assets. That might mean building a very different kind of company or product or target market; in fact that’s exactly the point. When you pick the battle you are best-suited to win, you have a higher chance of winning regardless of the unpredictability of the world around you.\\nIntentionally reactive \\nIf you cannot predict the future, one option is to spend no time whatsoever trying to plan. Just react to what you see now, and use your judgement and a long-term strategy to solve the immediate opportunities while advancing a long-term agenda.\\nWe know, we know… iterate fast, learn fast, get to the right answer fast. We know that, we say that, but then we take four months to deliver one feature, or take 18 months before we’re “ready” to launch. Truly embracing and living the idea of constant delivery, constant feedback, constant learning loops, constant adjustment of hypothesis, quick decision-making, quick updating of prior decisions, no ego tied up with who was right or wrong about what, treating all doors as two-way doors, more than lip-service but encoded into the DNA of the organization, can overcome unpredictable barriers. There was no real prediction to begin with, just a constant stream of hypotheses, continuously updated, possibly using frameworks and processes specifically designed for this mindset2.\\n\\n2\\n e.g. building in public; the OODA loop; Iterative Hypothesis Testing; Continuous Discovery, Continuous Delivery (not to be confused with Continuous Deployment, in which deployment is automated but isn’t happening many times per day)\\nHedged bets \\nIf you buy 30-year life insurance and live for 60 more years, you will make far more money than the insurance costs, so you come out ahead. If you buy 30-year life insurance and die in 2 years, your family will receive far more money than the insurance costs, so you come out ahead. Thus “insurance” is a way to always come out ahead, without predicting the future.\\nThe catch: You’ve reduced your maximum upside. In the 60-year case, you paid insurance premiums for 30 years while receiving no money in return. On balance, however, this “tax” is worth it, because you’re trading slightly less maximum upside for predictable, net-positive outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategies can also “buy insurance,” i.e. come out ahead either way, albeit with a tax. Examples:\\n\\nMultiple vendors for same service3. Shift workloads based on price and performance. (How would your price-negotiations go, if you were in this position of power?)\\nMultiple brands (whether created or acquired). Each finds a different niche, some will fail, some will take off. Common with acquisitions of growing companies, or the “house of brands” business model, or the “holding company” investment vehicle.\\nMultiple simultaneous solutions. To create iOS, Apple had the iPod team try to expand their OS to be more capable, while simultaneously having the Macintosh team try to reduce their OS to fit on a mobile device. One result was in-fighting, demonstrating that “cost” can be personal. But the result was that they selected the correct way forward for the iPhone.\\nRedundant systems. City power, and a generator. Multiple servers in different geographic regions. Teams, not solo engineers. Lying dials in airplanes. Redundancy is a cost, but the result is more predictable operation. As the military saying goes, “Two is one, one is none.”\\nDisrupt thyself. Create new products that disrupt your existing products. The quintessential example is Amazon launching the Kindle; Bezos instructed the newly-annointed Kindle leader—who was the leader over their book-selling business—that “Effective tomorrow, your job is to kill your old business with a Kindle.” Whether the future is in physical books, electronic books, or both, Amazon prospers.\\n\\n\\n3\\n Wrap 3rd-party APIs in a proxy layer. Use multiple public clouds. Process online transactions with more than one party. Keep your cash in more than one bank.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nExtreme novelty \\nZappos, Airbnb, Uber, SpaceX, Tesla, Bitcoin, OpenAI, all took enormous risk by creating a new category that everyone else thought was impossible, even after they heard the plan. On one hand, this is the definition of unpredictability. On the other hand, they avoided the unpredictability that comes from existing competition in existing markets. It doesn’t matter what’s happening at Amazon if you can return shoes for free even after 364 days; it doesn’t matter how the hotel industry is shifting when you’re selling a different experience; it doesn’t matter what Ford and Toyota are doing with electric vehicles if you’re changing the fundamental technology without the constraints of existing supply lines, dealer distribution rules, and ties to the oil and gas industry.\\nIf everything is unpredictable anyway, why not earn strategic advantage: No direct competition, exciting place for top-talent to join, immense upside.\\nThat upside does need to be immense for the risk to be rational. If it is, this a strategy for trading into a better set of uncertainties.\\nForm coalitions \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together\\n—African proverb\\n\\n\\nThe more massive the object, the more it resists being moved by external forces.\\nPrice-collusion4 removes the uncertainty of market pricing. Peace treaties prevent some wars. Open source projects attract more talent and advocates than any one organization could afford. Industry standards reduce the risk that core technology or protocols change, allowing members to build systems on top of those standard for decades, not having to “hedge.” Good things happen when we all agree to use HTTP, HTML, and SSL.\\n\\n4\\n This is unethical and illegal in many countries; don’t do it. It is illegal because it works, which makes it a good example.\\nExpand the scope of prediction \\nPredicting exactly what will happen is folly, but mapping possible futures can be illuminating:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n“Futures Cone” from Voros 2003, expanded by Sjef van Gaalen in 2016\\n\\n\\nPlotting possibilities that you believe are improbable, helps you recognize that perhaps they’re not quite as improbable, helps you think of solutions that mitigate plausible challenges5, and help you recognize if an “improbable” thing is in fact happening.\\n\\n5\\n The “pre-mortem” is an increasingly popular workshop for accomplishing this, in which you brainstorm answers to the following question: “It’s 12 months from now, and the project is a disaster. What went wrong?” The idea isn’t to solve everything you can imagine, but rather to pick a few things to intentionally mitigate, and intentionally leave the door open for mitigating other things if they come to pass.\\nOf course you’re still ignorant not only of probabilities, but of eventualities that you never predicted. Gaalen acknowledges this by further expanding the framework:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile this doesn’t mean you suddenly can predict the future, it might mean you’re paying more attention to what’s actually happening, allowing you to react faster, and thus to manage the unpredictability better.\\nStay simple \\nThe more tasks have to be broken-down, the more dependency arrows are drawn, the more intricate the analysis, the less believable the project estimate is. Complexity breeds unpredictability.\\nThe inverse is that simplicity is predictable. While not strictly true, is it true that simple things can be more predictable. A simple product, with a simple value proposition, in a simple market, has fewer dependencies that require prediction, and thus are more likely to succeed.\\nBet on what will not change \\nMade famous by Jeff Bezos, it is difficult to predict how the future will change, but it can be easy to predict the ways the future will not change. In Amazon’s case, he cites “low prices” and “fast delivery” as two of those things; in ten years, people will still want that. Therefore, Amazon can (and does) invest billions of dollars to achieve those results.\\nIn the case of WhatsApp, consumers want to chat and don’t want to pay; that was true ten years ago, it’s still true today, and it’s a good bet that it will be true ten years from now. In the case of WP Engine, the company I founded 14 years ago, people wanted websites to be fast, stay fast even when they get a lot of traffic, and be secure; they still do, and I’m sure they still will in another 14 years.\\n\\nAnd so the lessons are:\\n\\nHave a strategy, even though the world is unpredictable.\\nDecide quickly → get customer reactions quickly → learn quickly → make new decisions quickly.\\nUpgrade the strategy by following customer behavior.\\nProduct “abuse” is a strong signal for updating the strategy.\\nThe strategy must include building a moat or two.\\nThe strategy must create optionality in how to succeed (or avoid failure) so that single failures aren’t fatal.\\nThe strategy must leverage your existing strengths, building a product for a market for which you are already well-suited.\\nEither keep it simple, form coalitions, or do something completely novel.\\nBet on things that won’t change, rather than predicting how things will change.\\nDo your homework, but don’t stall in analysis paralysis. Map future possibilities, to mitigate possible things and to better notice when your assumptions turn out to be incorrect.\\n\\nThat’s how you win in an unpredictable world.\\n\\nMany thanks to Adam Brock, Amy Hoy, Daniel Zarick, Darla Cohen, Derrick Wolbert, John James Jacoby, KimSia Sim, Nitin Punjabi, Paul Huggins, Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, Rhys Jeffery, Seth Chasin, and Tony Meijer for contributing their insights to early drafts.\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNavigating the unpredictability of everything\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Predicting marketsPredicting salesPredicting winnersPredicting productThe SolutionStrategies that defeat unpredictabilityBuild a moatHave more than one way to succeedLeverage your assetsIntentionally reactiveHedged betsExtreme noveltyForm coalitionsExpand the scope of predictionStay simpleBet on what will not change\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Here is the correct model that you can use to understand and affect growth.\\n\\n\\nA startup is growing fast, the journalists marveling at its “meteoric rise.” But don’t meteors fall?\\nInevitably it is breathlessly inducted into the class of “hypergrowth” companies that are “growing exponentially.” Especially when the product is “viral.” After all, if every person brings three friends, and each of those brings another three, is that not exponential?\\nBut “exponential” is an incorrect characterization, as we’ll see in real-world data, even for hypergrowth, “viral” companies like Facebook and Slack.\\nThis article suggests an alternate model for how fast-growing companies actually grow. Understanding the model is useful not only for predicting growth, but because understanding the foundational drivers of growth allows us to take smarter actions to create growth in our own companies.\\nDispelling “exponential” \\nTo evaluate whether hypergrowth is properly described as “exponential,” let’s recall what that word means. Here’s an exponential curve (like\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\(y=2^x\\\\)), compared to a quadratic one (like \\\\(y=x^2\\\\)):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn exponential growth, values grow by a multiple. For example: In year 1 you grow 10, in year 2 by 100, in year 3 by 1000—each time the amount of growth is multiplied by ten. The compounding effect of multiplication causes the numbers to grow slowly initially, then skyrocket. The compounding effect gets journalists and VCs justifiably excited.\\n\\n\\n\\nCompound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.\\n—Albert Einstein\\n\\n\\nIn quadratic growth, values grow by a adding a constant amount more each time-interval, rather than multiplying a constant amount more each time-interval. In the same example, growing in year 1 by 10, then in year 2 by 20, in year 3 by 30:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessive values (in blue) are increasing more and more (in green). The green differences are increasing linearly: 10, 20, 30.\\n\\n\\nGrowth is still accelerating, so the blue curve slopes upwards, but gently compared to exponential growth.\\nWith these patterns in mind, let’s examine real-world data, and see whether “exponential” is the right model.\\n\\nFacebook is the definition of hypergrowth—getting to $50B in revenue faster than any company in history. The product is “viral”—friends bring other friends—which theoretically leads to “exponential growth.” But Facebook didn’t grow exponentially in the number of monthly active users:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEssentially linear for nearly twenty years, only exponential in the first four years.\\n\\n\\nSlack was the fastest-growing enterprise software company ever, going from $0 to $10M ARR in their first 10 months, and 0 to 10,000,000 active users in just five years. It’s also a “viral” product—organizations invite their members, who then create their own Slack-groups and invite others. So surely Slack has exponential growth?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlack’s own data shows initial quadratic growth, followed by years of linear growth.\\n\\n\\nIf you compare Slack’s growth with Microsoft Team’s growth, do you still think Slack’s growth is “exponential?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDropbox was another “hypergrowth” company, achieving 100,000,000 registered users five years after being founded in 2007, but it wasn’t exponential, neither in freemium users nor in revenue, early nor later in life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nEarly in life, Dropbox registered users grows non-exponentially, nearly exactly 100M per year\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nLater in life, Dropbox revenue grows linearly, and slows down\\n\\n\\nTrello grew fast too, getting to 10,000,000 registered users in three years. But not exponentially:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft grew in part due to “network effects” according to their S1, but this chart they presented shows that active rider growth isn’t exponential:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHubspot’s revenue curve is astonishingly consistent, despite hitting multiple inflection points1 in their business:\\n\\n1\\n e.g. launching new business models like selling through agencies instead of only directly, launching new product lines like sales CRM on top of marketing automation tools, and scaling the number of customers and employees by 10x\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyzing this last example, we arrive at a new, non-exponential model.\\nHypergrowth is quadratic \\nThe language we use can determine the thoughts we have.\\nThe Hubspot slide says “41% CAGR.” “CAGR” means annualized growth rate. They’re saying that if you start with the first number on the slide, then from there plot growing 41% per each year, compounding each year upon the previous, for seven years, you would arrive at the last number on the slide. This is exactly the definition of “exponential”—multiplying by a number repeatedly. In general when you use “CAGR” or “percentage growth” as a metric, you are implicitly saying “This is an exponential process.”\\nBut Hubspot didn’t grow by 41% every year; in this timeframe, it started at 60% and ended around 30%:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExponential curves have a constant year-over-year growth rate, therefore this is not exponential growth.\\n\\n\\nIf instead we examine growth in absolute dollars, rather than in percent, a pattern emerges. In the first set of four quarters on this report, they grew $17M. The next set grew $23M. Then $28M. Then $34M. Each year $5-7M more than the previous. This is the definition of a quadratic—adding an amount that increases by a constant amount each period, not multiplying.\\nCharting these year-over-year revenue differences in absolute dollars rather than in percent, it’s clear that indeed the changes were almost completely linear for years, then suddenly changed in 20202 to a new (but still linear) rate:\\n\\n2\\n Coinciding with the launch of a new product: Hubspot CMS Hub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is therefore mathematically inevitable that plotting a quadratic curve (rather than exponential) on top of Hubspot’s revenue data will be a perfect fit:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you said “best-fit,” you weren’t kidding!\\n\\n\\nMy thesis is that High-growth3 companies grow quadratically, not exponentially.\\n\\n3\\n My guess is low-growth companies are similar, but data are more easily available for the runaway-growth companies who publicly flaunt their success.\\nThe consequence of this conclusion is important for operators and analysis and investors. These are all people trying to understand—and possibly change—growth drivers. Getting the right language, and the right model, will lead to right analysis, and right action.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nWhy marketing-driven products grow quadratically: A first-principles explanation \\nIt’s not enough to draw best-fit lines on top of PowerPoint slides. We have to explain why this model makes sense, which in turn will create a better understanding of the growth drivers in our own companies.\\nWe’ve been taking a macro view of growth, looking at multi-year trajectories. Now we’ll peer into the microscope instead of the telescope, and consider how growth arises from a single marketing campaign.\\nThe life of a marketing campaign \\nIn my experience, marketing campaigns follow this pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the foot of the curve, we’ve launched a new campaign, but it’s ineffective; we haven’t figured out the best design and messaging and calls-to-action for this new medium and audience. Sometimes we never figure it out, and abandon the effort4.\\n\\n4\\n It’s hard to distinguish (a) our failure to build effective copy and conversion funnels from (b) channels that are fundamentally a bad fit for our market or product. This uncertainty, together with the rapid evolution of digital marketing, suggests that we should retry campaigns in previously-failed channels every few years.\\nBut in the case that we unlock the secret of efficacy, the campaign rapidly reaches a natural level of contribution; in this example, a number of “sales per week.” The specific level depends on many things: ad inventory, our budget, audience-receptivity, and the consonance between the audience and our target market.\\nNext we enter the optimization phase. We A/B Test our way to incrementally better results. Also we enjoy the result of multiple exposures—most people need to see the ad more than once before they act.\\nFinally we enter a phase of decline. There are various causes, all instructive:\\n\\nThe audience saturates. Everyone in the channel has seen the ad more times than is required to act; it’s now falling on deaf ears. Even if the audience is growing, the number of new people is small compared to the number of people that were new-to-us when we began the campaign.\\nThe channel declines. A media site that was popular loses readers through over-monetization. An event that was well-attended loses favor. A newsletter that was frequent and insightful becomes less frequent or other writers take over. A podcast moves to a closed platform and loses many listeners.\\nThe auction becomes uneconomical. For auction-based systems like Google and Facebook advertisements, or other zero-sum programs like affiliates or limited-inventory spots on newsletters or podcasts, the winner is the one who will pay the most. What is cost-effective for one bidder will be laughably overpriced for another, due to better conversion rates, higher revenue per customer, higher profitability per customer, or due to categorization as a “loss leader” or other way of ascribing value beyond immediate pay-back.\\n\\nThis curve leads to actionable ideas for managing marketing (given at the end of this article), but also forms my central thesis about how all sorts of growth works at companies. So I’m giving it a name:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow the idealized marketing campaign converts to growth \\nThe model above shows the number of sales per week the campaign contributes. To understand how this looks in terms of revenue growth, let us suppose a simple business model in which all sales are for a recurring revenue product generating $10 per month, with a 1% per month cancellation rate. How will revenue grow over time?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrowth initially accelerates as the campaign is solved, then grows roughly linearly as the campaign is optimized, and then starts sagging (although still growing!) as the campaign declines, and as the now-sizable customer base produces a non-trivial number of cancellations.\\n\\n\\nThe layer-cake of quadratic growth \\nMarketing departments don’t stop at a single campaign. They add new ones. Some are bigger than others, some can be optimized more than others, some decline sooner than others, some decline more precipitously than others.\\nSo, let’s model that: A variety of Elephant Curves, with differing parameters, beginning at different times, stacking the revenue-contribution of each to arrive at overall revenue growth for the company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLayered campaigns create a “wavy quadratic.”\\n\\n\\nScan your eye across the top of this kaleidoscopic cake, and you trace a wavy quadratic. This makes sense mathematically, because each campaign is essentially linear after it gets going, even if it sags during decline. “Adding more linear things over time” is the definition of a quadratic.\\nThe reason it’s “wavy,” is that when we unlock a new campaign we get a burst of growth. Do real-life revenue curves exhibit this waviness? Maybe so; here’s another slide from the Hubspot deck:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHubspot didn’t just add new marketing channels, however, but also layered on new geographies and new products. Do those activities have the same effect as marketing campaigns?\\nMultiple product lines at marketing-driven companies: Still quadratic \\nSo far we’ve assumed a single product, driven by marketing campaigns. High-growth companies who want to continue growing quickly after their first product reaches scale, must launch new products into new markets.\\nIs the Elephant Curve also the shape of an entire product line? After all, products often have an initial slow-growth period (because only cutting-edge early adopters are eager to pay to “be first” with bugs and missing features), followed by a faster expansion period, then reach some sort of natural ceiling, and possibly enter a period of decline (as the market evolves or competition overwhelms).\\nIndeed, this is what we see with many products, especially those that are marketing-driven, and without recurring-revenue. iPod sales, for example, are a perfect match:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt should therefore be unsurprising when we look at the overall revenue chart for Apple, and once again see quadratic growth on the top-line, admittedly with a special one-time bump for the unprecedented5 success of the iPhone:\\n\\n5\\n It is rare for a second product to dramatically outpace the first; even juggernauts like Google, Amazon, and Facebook never achieved that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach product is in a different phase of its lifecycle: The iPod declined to zero, the iPad is still declining; Macs are teetering but essentially flat; iPhones and software services are still increasing.\\nThe quadratic explanation for “growth decay” \\nIt’s well-known that growth—as a percentage—naturally declines with scale, even when there’s nothing wrong with the company.\\nThis law of nature has been given a name: Growth Decay (or sometimes Growth Persistence). Because of the traditional insistence of talking about growth as a percentage, the concept is articulated this way: If a company grew X% last year, it’s likely to grow a bit less than X% this year. With this formulation, the question becomes: How much less?\\nThe data give us the answer of 85%, although with \\\\(R^2 = 0.51\\\\), this is a tendency but far from a law:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith our new appreciation that growth isn’t exponential, and therefore “percentage” might be the wrong way to characterize growth, we could ask what curve would best model the idea of Growth Decay? Specifically, let’s plot revenue for an initially-fast-growing company that is subject to the principle of Growth Decay:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first leg of the curve is quadratic. While mathematically not identical, the best-fit quadratic curve for this data has a staggering \\\\(R^2 = 0.999\\\\).\\nThis is yet another signal that quadratic growth is the correct model.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nBeyond marketing campaigns: “Viral” and other forms of “exponential” growth \\nBut some products really do grow exponentially. In theory.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they’re not.\\n—Benjamin Brewster\\n\\n\\nSome products don’t grow proportionally with marketing and sales, but instead self-propel with a mechanism that theoretically ought be exponential. There are at least three ways for this to happen:\\n\\nVirality. When each user invites on average another \\\\(a\\\\) users, then each of those \\\\(a\\\\) new users bring in another \\\\(a\\\\) new users, so we end up with \\\\(a^2\\\\) more. Then each of those brings in another \\\\(a\\\\) which yields \\\\(a^3\\\\) . Then \\\\(a^4\\\\) and so on; this is the definition of exponential growth. Biological viruses grow exponentially for a similar reason, justifying the label.\\n\\n Examples: social media, chat clients, peer-to-peer payment platforms, massively-multi-player games, fantasy sports leagues \\n2. Word-of-Mouth. All products have some word-of-mouth component, but here we’re referring to products that are primarily driven this way; this creates a growth process that is similar to viral. Typically the mechanism of “telling others” is built into the product, rather than bolted on by marketing or generated by goodwill. The difference between “word-of-mouth” and “viral,” is that viral products are unusable unless you invite others to become users (thus exponential growth is enforced) whereas word-of-mouth products encourage sharing. Thus chat clients are viral because without inviting others you can’t chat, whereas Wordle6 was word-of-mouth, because you play the game alone, but are encouraged to share results on Twitter, which in turn brings in new users.\\n\\n6\\n Wordle exploded from 90 players in November 2021, to 300,000 in December, to 2,000,000 in January, when it was bought by the New York Times.\\n Examples: gamified products that generate significant sharing (self-improvement, game-results), consumer-to-consumer marketplaces where being a buyer plants the idea of becoming a seller (eBay, Airbnb, Uber); organizations with a cause that creates on-going buzz (brazenly unique cultures, a passionate higher purpose, something people feel is linked to their personal identity). \\n3. Hot Trend. Products that “everyone” (in some well-defined market) is going to buy. For smartphones, that might be half the population of the world. For internet search, that might be 100% of the online world. For backend management systems for large hospital chains, that could be 1000 potential customers. These products hit “tipping points” where “suddenly everyone buys it.” Even if, like internet search, the product has no explicitly viral nor word-of-mouth component—when you search on Google, you don’t “invite friends” to also search on Google—the ubiquity and inevitability of the trend leads to an explosion of users.\\n Examples: word-processing, spreadsheets, broadband internet, the smartphone, the shifts to cloud computing and online shopping, major media delivery platforms of radio, TV, DVD, and video streaming,\\nLogistic growth: Nearly the right model for virality \\nProducts cannot grow forever, for the obvious reason that markets are finite. The Facebook virus spread to billions of people, but not infinite. Smartphones have been purchased by billions of people, but not infinite.\\nTherefore, even if “exponential” is the correct model for the core growth mechanism of the product, it nevertheless cannot continue growing exponentially because it runs out of market. Furthermore, markets tend to have so-called “low-hanging fruit”—customers who are more eager to buy—so although the virus spreads exponentially through these easy-pickings, it runs into the majority of people who will buy, but maybe later, maybe after more of their friends or competitors are using it, maybe if it’s less expensive, maybe once it has more features, maybe once it supports integration with specific other software, and all manner of other excuses. The virus has more trouble infecting these high-strung fruits, so growth slows.\\nThis suggests a curve that starts exponentially, but then slows as it runs into the soft back-pressure of more demanding customers, and finally flattens out completely as it runs into the hard limit of the size of the addressable market.\\nBiologists have already done the work for us, because this is the correct model not just for viral products, but biological viruses infecting a population—akin to product types 1 and 2 above. Intriguingly, this is also the correct model7 for the diffusion of a gas across a membrane—akin to product type 3. The mathematical model for all of these processes is the logistic curve:\\n\\n7\\n The similarity is that in both cases you have a sudden demand that enters into a new space, but which slows and eventually stops as the new space becomes saturated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe logistic curve is exponential in the early days when it is far away from its natural limit. As the product (or gas or virus) gets to around 25% market penetration (or infections or saturation), the curve flattens into linear growth, in a tension between the exponential force of growth, countered by fewer and more demanding remaining targets. Finally it levels out at what is called the “carrying capacity”—the fully-saturated market.\\nThe logistic curve is evident in the real world, in all three product types:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nTwitter is a type 1 “Viral” product that follows the logistic model\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nPinterest is a type 1 “Viral” product that follows the logistic model\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\neBay is a type 2 “Word-of-mouth” in the number of buyers, following the logistic model (though also sagging towards the end, reminiscent of the Elephant Curve)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\neBay also follows the logistic model in the number of sellers (with even more pronounced sagging)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nSmartphones are a type 3 “Hot Trend” that follows the logistic model all the way to saturation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nSmartphone usage, separate from smartphone sales, is also logistic. Many pundits predicted this percentage would grow nearly without bound; in fact it saturated at 55%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe internet is a type 3 “Hot Trend” product with a near-exact logistic shape; at 66% global penetration, it hasn’t reached carrying-capacity, but it’s been in its linear mode for many years, and fell off the exponential path sooner than you might have expected\\n\\n\\nStacking logistic growth: The quadratic reappears \\nMarketing-driven products demonstrated quadratic growth, especially once Elephant-shaped campaigns and products were stacked. How does this differ with logistic growth?\\nAs already pointed out, logistic growth is similar to the Elephant Curve. The “high growth” portion of a marketing campaign might in fact be logistic; a product might extend that period into years rather than weeks, and the absolute magnitude of the result might be many times larger.\\nIf this idea is correct, we ought to see viral-like products exhibit a similar curve to the iPod curve—i.e. a product with initially-exponential growth, then a flattening, perhaps with some small growth, then on a long-enough timeline, a decline. An Elephant with a more stretched-out trunk.\\nThe Facebook Messenger product appears to exhibit at least the first half of the logistic curve:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, this curve is actually a sum of US growth and outside-US growth. Looking only inside the US, Facebook Messenger is further along the curve, past the linear mid-section and already leveling out near some carrying-capacity:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe same thing happens with Facebook DAUs and MAUs8. DAUs in the United States and Canada are logistical and have already topped-out at an apparent natural carrying-capacity of 185 million:\\n\\n8\\n Daily Active Users, Monthly Active Users\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBreaking out MAUs by all geographies reveals that top-line growth of users is an aggregate of some geographies essentially not growing at all (late in the curve), while others are still growing, albeit also linearly (middle of the curve):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of these individual effects of different products, released at different times, in different geographies, each with a “marketing campaign” style growth curve, is that it adds up to linear growth:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExponential growth for the first few years crashes down into linear growth for nearly twenty years, from large-scale logistic-shaped products and geographies\\n\\n\\nDoes this conform to the Elephant Curve? Is this really still essentially quadratic? The answer is clear when we plot the same data, this time measuring the year-over-year change in MAUs. Not as a percentage, but as numbers:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook MAU growth is indeed an Elephant Curve: Logistic at first, then flat(ish), then starting to decline.\\n\\n\\nWhy do we keep seeing this pattern, even at the scale of Facebook, one of the most “viral” products of all time? Because mathematically, things that look like an Elephant Curve, even if the logistic “trunk” is elongated over time, are linear for nearly their entire lifetimes. Everywhere except the very beginning. Adding up linear things definitionally creates a quadratic.\\nAs a striking example of this claim—that multiple, various Elephant Curves result in quadratic growth in the real world—consider the detail behind the earlier chart of Global Internet Users over time, a type 3 product. Every country has grown logistically, at a variety of starting-times, diffusion rates, and carrying capacities, yet the aggregate is quadratic:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Click to Enlarge)\\n\\n\\nThirty years of varied logistic growth adds up to quadratic growth\\n\\n\\nTo be certain the graph at the bottom (which is the same data as the chart shown earlier) is specifically quadratic, we chart the absolute difference in online population year by year. In a quadratic, these differences should grow linearly, i.e. each year adding a constant amount more than the previous year added. Which is indeed what we find, as precisely as we could expect from data in the messy real-world:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBringing it back down to the scale of a single company, consider Netflix, another type 3 product. While their overall growth accelerates, under the hood we can see the US is was already in a phase of slow-growth by 2014, with outside-US is taking up the slack through 2019:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nA quadratic top-line, created by two roughly-linear geographies\\n\\n\\nIf we chart the changes in subscribers, rather than totals, it’s even more clear that growth in the US has been in the declining phase of the Elephant Curve for a while, with outside-US is growing linearly:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then, fast-forwarding to 2023, looking at total, global subscribers, we see that growth slowed outside of the US as well, and the familiar Elephant Curve returns in its entirety:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLogistic growth with a varying carrying capacity: Start with market-share \\nSuppose you’re Facebook, and you’ve saturated many markets. You might be at carrying-capacity for those markets, but more people are still coming online. The markets are growing, so your carrying-capacity is growing, so you should still be able to grow too.\\nIndeed, recalling the charts above, Facebook’s current MAU growth rate, and that of global Internet users, both are currently hovering around 7% per year. Which isn’t a coincidence.\\nLet’s plot Facebook’s MAUs as a percentage of people online—their market share.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Elephant Curve strikes again\\n\\n\\nFinally we have the complete answer to why Facebook’s growth appears so “linear,” when the theory expects an Elephant Curve. When you examine growth relative to market size it is an Elephant, complete with logistic trunk, optimized back, and declining rump (even despite a COVID bump).\\nThis is why at-scale companies are willing to spend billions of dollars increasing the size of the market—it’s one of the few ways to create growth other than raising prices. So Google spent billions on Loon—a subsidized service to bring low-cost internet to remote areas of the world. Its problem-statement is the first text on its website: “Billions of people across the globe still don’t have reliable, affordable access to the internet.” Or, putting it another way, “Wifi balloons are a kooky idea but how else are we going to increase the carrying-capacity of the ‘global internet user’ Elephant Curve?”\\nOr Facebook with its “Free Basics” system that (in their words) “Helps people discover the relevance and benefits of connectivity with free access to basic online services.” Except actually it’s only a few, hand-curated websites, all of which just happen to be western consumer products companies that are large Facebook advertisers, and the only available social network just happens to be Facebook. And there’s no email, so I hope you like Facebook Messenger. In other words, a digital colonialism whose purpose is to increase the carrying capacity of Facebook MAUs and the advertising that goes with it.\\nElephant Curves are more visible when we plot growth as market share, because this incorporates the idea that carrying-capacity of the underlying market can itself be a moving target.\\nLogistic growth with a varying unit revenue \\nWe’ve largely been analyzing users rather than revenue, and for good reason: The lifeblood of any product is people who use it, regardless how much money it can extract in the process.\\nHowever, when we turn to revenue, we find that curves can become perkier. Facebook’s user growth might be linear, but could it be that revenue is exponential? It’s certainly not linear:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe already know Facebook’s user growth is linear, so the missing piece is Facebook’s revenue per user:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLogistic or Elephant yet again\\n\\n\\nPerhaps by now we’re not shocked to see the Elephant Curve once again. And we also know how the rest of the story goes: Because MAUs are Elephantine (which means mostly linear), and revenue-per-user is Elephantine (which means mostly linear), when you multiply them you get a quadratic, not an exponential, and that’s what we see in Facebook’s overall revenue growth.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nActionable conclusions \\nWhen we seek out the Elephant Curve in our marketing channels, product lines, geographies, and verticals, not just in its hopefully-explosive initial phase, but its phases of optimization and decline, we can proactively look for these phases, and take action.\\nModel by component \\nOur final discussion on the value of analyzing components of growth separate leads to a prescription for analyzing growth.\\n\\nEstimate the growth curve for the entire market. Expect to be Elephantine (or simply logistic, in the case of trends that you can reasonably assume will not decline in the forecasted future, like global Internet use or smartphone use).\\nEstimate the product market-share curve. Expect to be Elephantine, and don’t be so bold as to assume your product will never decline relative to the market—are you better at execution than Facebook?\\nEstimate monetization, i.e. revenue per customer9. This curve might be Elephantine, but not necessarily. It is highly dependent on the product and market, on how distinct the product is competitively, on the budgets of the customers, and more. Facebook has a strong moat (network effect) and doesn’t charge end-users, so they (like Google) can raise prices consistently. A product in a commoditized market might never be able to raise prices, and thus must find growth in avenues like increasing usage, the introduction of companion products, expanding to other verticals or geographies, or by applying their technology to new markets.\\n\\n\\n9\\n The definition of “customer” should match whatever activity is most highly correlated with growth; this is also what “market share” should mean. For normal products people pay for, this is simply “paying customers,” but for example in the case of Facebook, this is MAUs at least, perhaps even DAUs.\\nYou get better models by predicting each of these components separately, then multiplying for a final growth prediction. You’re also better able to track the model against reality, as more data becomes available.\\n\\nBesides this break-down, there are many operational ideas suggested by the results above, especially for managing marketing campaigns.\\nThis might be expanded in a future article, but for now, these probing questions might lead to better ideas on how to analyze and affect growth:\\nAdvice for Marketing teams \\n\\n\\nIs our AdWords campaign topped out? Are we fooling ourselves into thinking there’s more inventory to access? How much more optimization is there to be had, and how would know? Are we hitting a decline due to uneconomical auctions, and if so, what is our reaction? When should we start experimenting with new channels, rather than continue to flog the AdWords channel for results that don’t exist?\\n\\n\\nIs it ok to be less cost-effective if it means we can stave off decline? Should we be that “irrational bidder” who bids “too much” because we’re wise enough to see value beyond immediate cash pay-back? If so, how do we quantify that value, so we know just how “irrational” to be?\\n\\n\\nTo hit our growth goals for the year, what would have to be true of the growth of existing campaigns? Which can be reasonably expected to grow, hold steady, or shrink, based on their phase? How many additional, successful campaigns do we need, and how soon? Since not all that we attempt will succeed, how many do we need to start to yield the final quantity we need?\\n\\n\\nRather than stack up small, limited campaigns, is there something more substantial that could generate more total growth? A single, large new geography instead of many smaller ones? A single, substantial new sales mechanism (e.g. reselling) rather than more advertising? A different pricing model instead of an additional sales model? Even if it takes 10x the effort, and possible even if it takes 10x the time, it might have 10x the results.\\n\\n\\nOr the reverse—do we pull funds when we smell decline, rather than spending our time and money fighting a losing battle, accepting a short-term hit on top-line growth in exchange for more efficient growth? Do we try to stack up many smaller, more efficient campaigns, generating growth as a bulk effort? Each effort affects the top line only marginally, but conversely our growth is less sensitive to the decline of any one campaign.\\n\\n\\nAdvice for Product Managers \\n\\n\\nIt’s great to add a feature to an existing product, but significant additional growth comes from increasing carrying capacity or creating a new avenue of growth. Early on you should focus on winning market share in one space, creating the first Elephant Curve, but after the product matures, something more drastic is required: Wholly new products, or updates significant enough to address new markets.\\n\\n\\nIt’s well-known that companies need to add additional products to continue fast growth after achieving scale. However the second product is highly unlikely to achieve same market share and monetary scale as the first, so there needs to be multiple, not just one10. This requires serious investment, parallel efforts, and the chutzpah to kill off the ideas that aren’t working.\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n This is true at any scale—advertising is still 82% of Google’s revenue; of that 71% is advertising from search alone (i.e. excluding YouTube and other properties). Apple revenue is 60% iPhone. Even at smaller scales: Basecamp (neé 37signals) built multiple products over nearly two decades but only their first was successful enough to be worth working on; the company divested itself of the rest and rebranded to be identical to that product. It is possible for second products to eclipse the first; the iPhone was of course not Apple’s first product; The Tesla model 3 outsells the earlier model X, And at my own company Smart Bear our second product ended up being 95% of sales, and we essentially did the same as 37signals and went to a single product model.\\n\\nBecause word-of-mouth-driven growth is so much more effective than marketing-driven growth (both in cost-per-customer and in that unlike direct advertising it grows automatically as the company grows), it is worth a great deal of time trying to figure out how to build that into the product, rather than relying only on the marketing team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHalf my advertising is wasted. I just don’t know which half.\\n—John Wanamaker\\n\\n\\nMr. Wanamaker made his famous complaint more than a hundred years ago; even with modern analytics, today it’s worse. The quadratic growth model won’t solve that puzzle, but the better you understand the mechanisms of growth, the more it is under your control. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-growth/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe Elephant in the room: The myth of exponential hypergrowth\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Dispelling “exponential”Hypergrowth is quadraticWhy marketing-driven products grow quadratically: A first-principles explanationThe life of a marketing campaignHow the idealized marketing campaign converts to growthThe layer-cake of quadratic growthMultiple product lines at marketing-driven companies: Still quadraticThe quadratic explanation for “growth decay”Beyond marketing campaigns: “Viral” and other forms of “exponential” growthLogistic growth: Nearly the right model for viralityStacking logistic growth: The quadratic reappearsLogistic growth with a varying carrying capacity: Start with market-shareLogistic growth with a varying unit revenueActionable conclusionsModel by componentAdvice for Marketing teamsAdvice for Product Managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Here’s how.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPricing is much more about positioning and perceived value than it is about cost-analysis and unconvincing ROI calculators. Let’s see how repositioning can result in a much higher price for the same product.\\nYou’ve created a marketing tool called DoubleDown that doubles the cost-efficiency of AdWords campaigns. You heard that right folks—as a marketer, you can generate the same impact, the same number of conversions, the same quality of sales leads, but with half your current ad-spend. Wonderful! Who doesn’t want higher ROI.\\nWhat can you charge for this tool? Well, the customer will save a certain amount of money on ad-spend; surely you cannot charge more than that. Let’s say you can charge 25% of the savings and still find many willing customers.\\nHere’s what your sales pitch looks like to a customer who spends $40,000 per month on AdWords:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat deal! The VP of Demand Gen will be able to boast to the CMO that she saved the company $15,000/mo even after paying for DoubleDown, and you’re raking in a cool $5,000/mo. Everyone’s happy!\\nNow let’s see how to charge eight times as much money for the same product.\\nMarketers have a paramount goal: Growth. Even indirect marketing like brand, events, and PR have the indirect goal of supporting growth. In the case of DoubleDown’s customers it’s direct: Growth through lead-generation through AdWords.\\nIncreasing growth is much more valuable than decreasing cost. To see why, consider the following two scenarios:\\n\\n\\nCMO reports to the CEO: I was able to reduce costs 20% this year.  The CEO is happy. The CEO’s follow-up question is: How will we use those savings to grow faster?\\n\\n\\nCMO reports to the CEO: I was able to increase growth by 20% this year, but it also cost us 20% more to achieve.  The CEO pumps her fists amongst peels of joyous laughter. The value of the company increases non-linearly. The additional revenue growth more than pays for the additional marketing cost that generated it. The CEO’s follow-up question is: Can we spend even more? How can we ensure this happens again next year?\\n\\n\\nIt’s always 10x more valuable for a business to grow faster than it is for the business to save money.\\nThis insight points us to an alternate pitch for DoubleDown. It’s not about spending less for the same amount of growth, it’s about spending more to create more growth.\\nContinuing our example, suppose the customer generates 200 quality sales leads per month from their $40,000/mo spend. The sales pitch changes as follows:\\nYou’re paying $200/lead right now, yielding 200 leads per month. Using DoubleDown, you can double the number of leads you’re generating, still at a cost of $200/lead:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe customer is willing to spend $40,000 to generate 200 leads, and therefore is happy to spend $80,000 to generate 400 leads. It doesn’t matter how much of that $80,000 is going to AdWords versus going to DoubleDown. The goal is not to “save money on AdWords,” but rather to “generate more growth at a similar unit cost.”\\nIn the “saves money” pitch, the value was $20,000, and the customer needed to keep 75% of that value-creation. Whereas in the “generate growth” pitch, the value is $40,000, and the customer is happy to pay 100% of that value-creation to a vendor. Both the amount of value created, and the percentage of value the customer is willing to pay, is a multiple higher for the “growth” pitch versus the “save money” pitch.\\nSo the next time you want to formulate your product as a way to “save time” or “save money” or “be more efficient” …. don’t.\\nInstead, figure out how your product creates value in the way your customer already measures value, and position your product as a way to accomplish that.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/more-value-not-save-money/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow repositioning a product allows you to 8x its price\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Buyers, users, existing customers, curious explorers, all working at companies large and small.\\nMost companies approach this the wrong way, which is to speak to “everyone.” The worry is, if you were to speak only to a narrow customer segment, everyone else feels excluded or confused, and will bounce off the home page and buy something else. So you end up with generic positioning statements like “The Power To Know.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSAS is the The Power To Know®, but know what exactly?\\n\\n\\nSAS has trademarked “The Power To Know®” but I’m not sure why. Can you tell me what the product does? Who it’s for? Did you read that entire paragraph? Surely not.\\nCould anyone in the world—even their perfect, ideal, best customer (ICP: Ideal Customer Profile)—be intrigued and excited to learn more? If that ICP happened across the website, would they even know they are the ideal customer?\\nThe first step in disabusing yourself of this fluffy language is to see that by not speaking to a specific customer, you’re saying nothing to everyone and thus everyone will bounce off the home page, and never think of you again. (You didn’t give them anything to think about.) If your ideal customer doesn’t know you’re selling to them, who will?\\nBy the way, The Penny Group also delivers “The Power To Know®,” also trademarked. So much for trademarked differentiation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo much power! So much knowing!\\n\\n\\nGeneralized messaging has no power, no emotional connection, no interest, no information.\\nExactly the opposite of what you need from your advertising or home page.\\nThe next step in disabusing yourself of this idea of “speaking to everyone” is to acknowledge that it is impossible to speak to everybody at once. You want software developers to know you have an extensible API, but you want the corporate buyers to know that your product makes them more money. You want to look professional so that managers at large companies are comfortable trusting your company, but you don’t want to so aloof that small company buyers see you as “too corporate” and can’t relate. You want to highlight configurable workflows and reports that allow large customers to apply your tool to all their teams, but you want small customers to realize that you can turn all that off so things are simple and easy.\\nOnce you agree with these two points—you must be evocative and specific, and you can’t speak to everyone—you must conclude that you have to speak to just one type of customer.\\nBut how do you pick, and how you avoid excluding everyone else, reducing your target market to a tiny niche?\\nWe’ll start with the first question.\\nSelling to Carol \\nDescribe a perfect customer.\\xa0We’ll call her Carol. Pick a concrete company that she works for, a company similar to one of your existing, thrilled customers. What’s her official title and what does she do? If your potential market includes a wide variety of company types and positions, just pick one in particular. Whatever problems your product solves, Carol has all those problems. She has all the problems, she knows she has the problems, she already has the budget to spend on those problems, and she’s already looking for how to spend it, just like it says in your market analysis. Write those problems down from her point of view, the way she would describe them if complaining to a friend over lunch. Whatever advantages you have over your competitors1, Carol needs exactly those things. Whatever makes people love you2, Carol has those attributes. Whatever makes people continue paying for the product forever3, Carol has that. List all these things4.\\nCarol is literally custom-built to be blown away by your product.\\n\\n1\\n Not sure? Ask your Sales team—they’ll tell you, “oh yeah, any time someone says ______, I know we’re going to close the sale.“\\n2\\n Not sure? Ask your Support team—they’ll tell you, “oh yeah, the best people are ______ because they ask great questions and they’re always telling me how much they love us, even when they have a problem.“\\n3\\n Not sure? Look at your retention data—which customers stay forever, even if you think they shouldn’t? Not sure about that either? Use the Iterative-Hypothesis method to interview them—you need to do that anyway so you can build great products.\\n4\\n Some pundits recommend inventing a personal back-story like “Carol has two cats and loves Mahler.” Don’t do that. It’s irrelevant and inaccurate. Stick with professional attributes that determine who Carol is, what Carol is interested in, why she is interested in it, why she is looking for a new solution right now, how she makes those decisions, what her budget is, and so on, all topics listed in the aforementioned Iterative-Hypothesis method.\\nNow the question is: What would a web page / Google ad / print ad / trade-show booth / postcard be like, such that Carol would immediately understand that you are her savior? Remember, you get only 3 seconds to grab her attention and another 5-10 to convince her that your product is the second coming.\\nCan you make it clear in a picture? Maybe a before/after she can relate to? Will describing three features make it plain? Will pointing out your best competitive advantage make her weep for joy in finally finding a company who “gets it?” Can you ask a provocative question, something she identifies with? Is there a phrase where she’d laugh out loud because “that’s so true?”\\nYou only get a few seconds, so a paragraph won’t do. You have to communicate in a picture and a few words. The good news is you have to please only Carol, and you know Carol. You even know she’ll honestly be thrilled to find you.\\nIf your ad can’t grab Carol’s attention—your perfect customer—why do you think it will grab anyone else’s attention?\\nIf you still say it’s impossible to communicate your message in 5-10 seconds, no one in the world will get your message. Simplicity is as important in positioning as it is in strategy generally.\\nWhen you’re willing to speak only to your target audience, it is incredibly powerful:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwilio targets developers, even though the buyer isn’t a developer. This campaign was so effective, it turned into an entire book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDollar Shave Club was unabashedly “cheap but good,” and didn’t care about sleek advertising like Gillette. It got everyone’s attention because it was such a clear message, and sold razors to everyone, not cost-conscious consumers only.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubaru knows it isn’t cool; it highlights its positive attributes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubaru is about accessible, safe family life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPorsche’s message is… differentiated from Subaru’s.\\n\\n\\nSurprise: You’ll automatically sell far beyond Carol \\nNow let’s tackle the fear: That targeting Carol means you’re excluding the rest of the market, and therefore limiting your growth and reach, even if you perform well in your niche.\\nThat’s not what happens. Here’s what actually happens:\\nYou have a target market—the bullseye—and the center of that bullseye is Carol:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery product has strengths and weaknesses. For Subaru:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrengths\\nWeaknesses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n•\\xa0Low-cost  •\\xa0Reliable  •\\xa0Safe (top-rated by government)  • Rugged (take it off-road)\\n•\\xa0Low performance  •\\xa0Not sporty  •\\xa0Not cool  •\\xa0Ugly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarol is constructed such that she values everything on the left, and actively does not want anything on the right. To her, those aren’t weaknesses, those are actually strengths, because she wouldn’t be caught dead in a Porsche, her lifestyle isn’t sporty, and she disagrees with your definition of “cool” and “ugly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Carol isn’t the only person attracted to this set of trade-offs. There are other people who either like the things on the left or are at least indifferent to them, and are indifferent to the things on the right. For example: I drive my daughter to school, drive to work, and spend a lot of time on highways and residential roads, so I want something safe and reliable, and I don’t care about high performance or being sporty.\\nThat’s the next ring in the bullseye—people who generally value your positives and aren’t dissuaded by the weaknesses. There are 10x more of those people than there are of Carol. Let’s call that person Diana:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that’s not all. Buying a car—or anything—is always a set of trade-offs. You rarely find a product that fits your preferences perfectly, i.e. you’re rarely The Carol for any product. So, you weigh the pros and cons. Maybe I don’t care about being rugged because I don’t go off-road, but I do care about safety and reliability, and I’m neutral on cost. And on the weaknesses, I’m disappointed that it’s low-performance, and I do care what it looks like. But, I don’t care about “sporty” or “cool” specifically.\\nSo where does that leave me? Who knows—everyone will weigh these things differently. Clearly some of those people will still consider the Subaru to be the best-possible set of trade-offs, and there are 10x more of those kinds of people than there are of Diana. Call them Eddie:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is why targeting Carol means your target market is at least 10x larger (because of Diana) and more like 20x-100x larger (because of Eddie).\\nTargeting Carol makes your message clear, compelling, evocative, even emotional. But trade-offs are how people buy, and exactly because you were so clear about what those are, you’ve paved the road for many people to make that choice.\\nDoes this theory work in practice? \\nContinuing the Subaru example5, the advertisements above are about being low-cost but practical. These are attributes valued by many people. But in the 1990s, sales were in decline, so they researched which consumer segments were most likely to buy a Subaru. They found five categories: Teachers, healthcare professionals, IT professionals, “outdoorsy types,” and lesbians. Lesbians were the strongest category—four times more likely to buy.\\n\\n5\\n This story is expanded and cross-referenced in Alex Mayyasi’s 2016 article in Pricenomics.\\nTargeting lesbians was a risky move in the ’90s. There were still no mainstream TV shows or movies with gay characters, and celebrities were still in the closet. When Ellen DeGeneres (both a celebrity and star of a popular TV show) came out as gay in 1997, advertisers pulled out, including Chrysler. When Ikea ran a commercial featuring a gay couple, their stores received bomb threats.\\nBut as Warren Buffett says, “Be greedy when others are fearful,” and Subaru invested where others feared to tread.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwenty years before Lady Gaga’s “Born this way.”\\n\\n\\nThe campaigns were a hit, but not only with lesbians. Subaru grew faster in the subsequent ten years than any other car company6, and while the gay and lesbian demographic remained their strongest niche, the vast majority of people who bought a Subaru were straight. And they were buying the car because they value its attributes—affordable, safe, rugged—and because on balance they cared more about those than the attributes it lacks—sleek, sporty, high performance.\\nWhen you target Carol, your positioning is strongest, and you win where you deserve to win. But far more people will buy because they have similar purchasing preferences.\\n\\n6\\n Measured as a percentage of total sales volume from 1995 to 2005, of car companies that were founded before 1990.\\nFinding Carol in the noise \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a customer cancels, we need find out why—what did they think would happen, and how did we fail them? Unless the customer stopped their project or went out of business, cancellation indicates a gap between what we promised them (marketing) and what we delivered (product).\\nThis investigation is most urgent when the customer is Carol. You stipulated she is the perfect customer, but she disagrees. Perhaps the product needs to change, but perhaps your definition of Carol needs to change to better match what the product has turned out to be or what you are uniquely excellent at delivering, or some other facet of your strategy.\\nThe same could be said Diana, but when it comes to Eddie it’s less clear whether this is signal or noise. Eddie is a mis-match for some of our attributes, and might cancel as a result, but that doesn’t mean we should change those attributes, if they align with Carol and Diana. If we treat all customers as if they are Carol, and therefore all cancellation data as a vital signal, we lose track of building for Carol and we end up building for nobody.\\nSome customers aren’t even Eddie—they’re not on the bullseye, yet they signed up. You might think this would be rare, since it is irrational, but in fact it will happen all the time. You need to identify these customers and completely ignore their data—the noise will push you off course.\\nTherefore, you need a way of identifying who is a Carol. Ideally, right from the start, during on-boarding, maybe with a few questions, maybe based on activity indicating they’re in that perfect zone. Then, you can measure cancellation rates of Carol (the only rate you care about), and spend extra time finding out why they cancel. The “extra time” comes from the time you saved by not pursuing and interviewing other customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course it’s not just in cancellations that you want to segment the ICPs from the rest of the customers. It’s in your activation funnel. It’s in your trial or freemium conversion rate to paid. It’s in individual feature usage. It’s in conversion to monthly active users (meaning a single user actually using it consistently month over month). It’s in tech-support requests both for bug fixes and features. It’s in every aspect of understanding how customers are intersecting with our product and company. It’s always about the Carols; everything else is noise, and if you don’t separate the two, you can’t build the best product, for any definition of “best.”\\nThe typical failure mode for this is that your biggest customer, who you desperately want to keep because you really want that revenue, constantly occupies you in tech support and in feature requests, some of which you’ve implemented just for them, with the internal excuse that “if they want it, other larger customers probably will want it, so this is a path of growth,” yet they’re still perennially unhappy, unsatisfied, obviously a bad fit, an anti-Carol, but dangit you need that money and if we can just make this work there must be more customers like that coming.\\nAnd after all that, of course they leave in a huff, having been been incredibly unprofitable despite their high nominal revenue, and you should turn around and say, “Wait a minute, that customer was not in our bullseye all along.” Rather than noticing that from the start, and helping them to leave your company, you clung to them because you so desperately wanted it to work, and for good reason—it was a lot of money—but ultimately that wasn’t the right reason, and the whole thing was an enormous waste of time. You could have been finding and on-boarding a few more Carols instead, and they would still be here, happily paying you money, profitably.\\nYou’ll know that you’re doing this right when you turn down a sale, even though it would have been your largest customer, simply because they’re not your ICP, as in these miniature stories from Daniel Zarick at ArrowsHQ and John Doherty at EditorNinja. This separates first-time founders from seasoned founders.

(If you’re not sure whether you have Product/Market Fit, you don’t.)\\n\\n\\nIf every day it’s a struggle to get customers, it’s not working yet.\\nIf every day it’s a struggle to keep up with demand, it’s working.\\n\\n\\nIt is a momentum change from “push” to “pull”—a change from fighting for each customer, one at a time, to a flood of signups that you can’t even explain. It’s a change from “how do we get more customers” to “how do we handle the influx of demand?”\\nIt’s working. Something clicked, like a final puzzle piece snapping into place, a “fit,” and suddenly the floodgates are open.\\nIt’s not all good. The avalanche of customer complaints outstrip your ability to deliver bug fixes and simple enhancements. You feel behind in every department simultaneously; you can’t keep up with the work no matter how “productive” you are. You obviously should hire someone—and this new revenue means you can afford it—but who? Someone just like you, because you can manage them, or someone who complements you, so you can deal with the burgeoning scale? Does it even matter—you don’t have time to interview.\\nIt’s the proverbial “good problem to have,” but it doesn’t feel good in the moment, with a crushing workload and unhappy new customers, and your brand slipping away (“I heard they were good but it took them a day to answer my support question” says the public review). Although of course it is the best problem to have.\\nYou might think all this doesn’t matter—you’re just running your company; who cares how some article defines some term like “Product/Market Fit?” But it does matter, because it determines whether the company is sustainable, and fundamentally changes how you operate each day, how you plan for the future, whether and who you need to hire, and what you need to build, and whether you’re going to start tackling scale.\\n(P.S. How do you go from idea to this state? This is my PMF system that I used to build a unicorn.)\\n\\nWhat does Product/Market Fit look like numerically?\\nIn my experience building several companies myself and angel-investing in dozens of others (with a wide range of outcomes), I define Product/Market Fit as all of the following:\\n\\nEasy growth (pull, not push): Growth rate suddenly spikes up, and sustains at the new rate. You often don’t know why.\\nHigh retention: Cancellation under 3%/mo (for B2B) or 5%/mo (for B2C), because if customers are leaving in droves, you are not a “fit.”\\nCritical mass: At least $20,000/mo in revenue or increasing WAU’s by at least 200/mo. Everyone can grow 1000% month-of-month when the baseline is 7 customers; the fact that you have only 7 customers means there’s not yet evidence of “fit1.”\\n\\n\\n1\\n What if you have a single huge customer? Congratulations, lots of people would love to have a huge customer; great start. That demonstrates you have fit for a single customer, but not for a market; that’s consulting, not product.\\nWhat follows are the data to back up this definition, that also matches the lived experience which is really the essence of hitting Product/Market Fit, where life will never be the same again.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nThe characteristic growth curve of “Product/Market Fit” \\nBootstrapped products \\nWhen you see growth charts like Pallyy’s, you can see the exact moment when Product/Market Fit was reached:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nPallyy’s four-year MRR\\n\\n\\nSuccessful startups often have a growth curve like Pallyy’s: Revenue growing linearly, slowly, often for about two years, then in a moment—Product/Market fit—when it suddenly turns upward, and continues growing at that new trajectory.\\nThe new growth is still linear, but dramatically faster. In particular, it is not exponential, though that’s the word people frequently use (this universal fallacy is explained here).\\nConvertKit was similar, bumping along for two years before growing quickly but linearly, just like Pallyy:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nConvertKit’s early MRR growth\\n\\n\\nAnd then that growth continued linearly, not “exponentially” as many pundits like to say:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nConvertKit’s scale-up MRR growth\\n\\n\\nYou can see the sudden change between “every sale is a struggle” and “the orders just won’t stop coming in.”\\nConvertKit founder Nathan Barry famously tells the story of how he personally reached out one by one to his ideal target customers, manually onboarding them to not only get the sale but to get the testimonial2. It’s a brilliant playbook that others would be wise to copy. It’s also what it means to hard-scrabble for customers, and it’s really obvious when the forces flipping from having to scratch and claw for every dollar of revenue, to the company running away from him.\\n\\n2\\n I was one of them; perhaps you’re reading this article because of an email from my newsletter, which is still on ConvertKit.\\nVC-funded products \\nThese companies were bootstrapped, but the it’s same in the world of venture, because Product/Market Fit is about products and markets and customers and fits, not about funding models. My company WP Engine started 14 years ago self-funded but two years later became VC-funded, eventually raising more than $300M, experiencing hyper-growth3 for a decade, yet it exhibits the same two-year slow-growth preamble to high-growth, and both linear:\\n\\n3\\n Often defined as 2T3D, i.e. in successive years after attaining $1M in annual revenue, the company’s revenue triples, triples, doubles, doubles, and doubles, thereby getting close to $100M five years later; WP Engine did that and more, starting with 5x.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWP Engine’s early growth curve\\n\\n\\nYou can’t tell from the chart when we first raised money (it wasn’t January of 2012), nor subsequent rounds, nor the size of the rounds. The shape of growth is a force that transcends all of it.\\nI distinctly remember when we flipped to “Product/Market Fit.” Only five of us, completely sustainable, and suddenly everything changed. We fell behind on our stellar tech support; one of the dangers of bragging about how “the founder does Zendesk tickets” is that process doesn’t scale. We couldn’t keep up with our free white-glove site-migration service for new customers. And then, completely behind on all work, trying to stand up new servers and answer phone calls, knowing we needed to hire, we got even more behind because hiring takes time—finding candidates, interviewing, not wanting to hire the wrong person just because we’re moving fast, and even after we hired, there’s no documentation or training, so we’re just working side by side, hoping folks learn by osmosis, while the team gets even further behind. And customers were complaining on Twitter that our service is going downhill—and worst of all, they were right. They blamed it on us raising money; what they didn’t know is we hadn’t spent a dollar of it yet; in fact our error was not spending the money on hiring ahead of need, to blunt the impact of a growth increase.\\nWe did get back on top of it later in the year, and we’ve won all sorts of awards for our service, maintaining 98% CSAT to this day, because that’s who we are. But that’s not what it felt like in 2012.\\nThe same thing happens to the “cool kids” companies in Y-Combinator:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nAnonymous YC company growth chart from YC co-founder Paul Graham\\n\\n\\nThis isn’t a new phenomenon, nor a “SaaS” phenomenon. Peldi Guilizzoni famously shared his (one-time!) revenue for Balsamiq Mockups back in 2008:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nBalsamiq Markups one-time (not SaaS!) revenue, 2008\\n\\n\\nSecond products \\nHubspot is a hyper-growth VC-funded company, now public. Early on, you can see the linear behavior, fairly consistent even through the 2008 recession, as co-founder Dharmesh Shah indicates on a chart from his personal blog:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nHubspot’s early growth curve\\n\\n\\nSometimes there’s another shift in the slope of the line, when the company adds a second successful product, expands to a lucrative new market, or changes its business model. Hubspot, after twelve years of linear growth, changes to a new (but still linear) growth rate around 2021, around the time their second product-line reached its own fit:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nHubspot’s at-scale growth curve, exhibiting a bend, and linear on both sides of the change\\n\\n\\nViral products \\nAll of the previous examples were of B2B companies without “viral” or “network” effects, which are often associated with so-called “exponential growth.” However, even classic “viral growth” examples like Slack (at the time the fastest-ever-growing B2B company in history) and Facebook (at the time the fastest-ever-growing B2C company in history) did not grow exponentially. Instead, they grew in the same way again: linear, then a sudden change, then still linear but faster. Here’s Slack, which looks exactly like Hubspot:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nSlack’s early user growth curve\\n\\n\\nAnd Facebook with a material bend in early 2009 (coinciding with the introduction of the “like” button):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s early user growth curve\\n\\n\\nElsewhere, I’ve gone into great detail about why even viral products like Slack and Facebook specifically don’t grow exponentially.\\nYou can also see it in AirBnB with a bend in late 2010, coinciding with the realization that professional photography was the key to “fitting” with customer expectations:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nAirbnb’s final piece of the puzzle\\n\\n\\nMedia products \\nWhile I do think it’s more usual for media and social media to have a longer, slower curve, sometimes you see the Product/Market Fit pop, like Lenny Rachitsky’s newsletter:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nLenny’s Newsletter traffic\\n\\n\\nOh, and what did he do to cause that sudden growth? You guessed it:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bottom line is, these growth curves matching “fit” are common with all business models—B2B and B2C, recurring-revenue or one-time revenue, products or media, self-funded or VC-funded.\\nHigh cancellation means there’s no fit \\nThere is one killer metric that will stop growth in its tracks, even with the curves above: Cancellation.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nFounders often think cancellation of 5-7% per month is OK so long as they’re getting lots of new customers. But they are mistaken.\\nHigh cancellation puts a ceiling on growth. This is on public display with Buffer, who started with the same sort of linear-change-linear growth curve (2012-2014, then 2014-2020), but then growth leveled off (2020) and never returned (and even shrunk):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nBuffer’s ARR\\n\\n\\nThe reason is churn. Note how churn was higher during the slow-growth period of 2012-2014, then reduced to 5%/month, permitting faster growth:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nBuffer’s monthly cancellation rate\\n\\n\\nBut 5% is still too high; there’s no way to keep increasing new-customer acquisition to outpace churn, for the simple reason that “5%/mo” definitionally grows in lock-step with your total size, but marketing and sales does not continue to automatically grow just because your company is bigger. So, cancellations always win that race, and at 5%/mo, you top out pretty quickly:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nBuffer’s unit economics; new-MRR naturally tops out, whereas cancellation never stops growing in absolute dollars.\\n\\n\\nYou can see a similar effect at SparkToro, an impressive company that is a testament to founder Rand Fishkin’s vision to build a great company instead of a company that attempts to accelerate growth forever; he explains how SparkToro generates enviable profit, with happy employees, happy customers, and happy investors. So this isn’t an indictment of the company, but it is a demonstration of the growth-destroying power of high cancellation rates:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nSparkToro is consistent in adding the same dollars-per-month of new-MRR, but their consistent cancellation rate continues to grow in dollars per month, which means at their current size, cancellation “wins” that race, and growth becomes flat.\\n\\n\\nIt’s not actually about finances; it’s the fact that customers are choosing to leave. The numbers are the objective measure that this is happening, but they’re not the point. The point is that customers don’t want to stay. That means it’s not a fit.\\nTherefore, both because “lots of customers leaving means it’s not a fit” and because high cancellations means the growth curve will quickly flatten, cancellation higher than 3% for B2B or 5% for B2C indicates a lack of Product/Market Fit.\\nEasy inbound growth is indeed a sign of fit, but if customers leave in droves, it means the promise was right, the price was right, but the product didn’t deliver, or the customer’s need was too brief to sustain a recurring-revenue business.\\nSome people call this “a fit, but not sustainable” or “a fit, just with limited upside.” I call it a lack of fit, because if customers are leaving, it’s not a fit4. Don’t get distracted by dollars. Pay attention to customer behavior.\\n\\n4\\n See this amazing five-minute segment from founder of Twitch Michael Seibel, describing how his Socialcam app got 60M downloads in 4 months and top-5 on the App Store, yet retention was so horrible (almost zero retained users after 10 days) that despite that inconceivable growth, it was not Product/Market Fit.\\nIf your company is growing slowly, that doesn’t mean you failed. It just means you haven’t hit that success curve yet, and haven’t found Product/Market Fit.\\nMaybe you never will, but you’ll grind out a profitable company anyway. Maybe you never will, and growth is so slow, it’s best to face facts, stop, figure out why it was too hard, and try something else. Or maybe your growth spurt will start today.\\nMaybe if you just follow my roadmap to Product/Market Fit, which I used to build a unicorn, you will succeed. Then again, in that same article I explain that my previous startup only used half of those ideas.\\nNo one knows; that’s life. But now you know what it looks like, when it is truly a fit.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/product-market-fit/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProduct/Market Fit (PMF): Experience & Data\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)The characteristic growth curve of “Product/Market Fit”Bootstrapped productsVC-funded productsSecond productsViral productsMedia productsHigh cancellation means there’s no fit\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Nothing. If you don’t come away knowing something new and actionable at the end of the interview, you’ve wasted your time and theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the Lean Startup method they call this “validating your ideas,” so it’s tempting to spend the time convincing the person to provide you with validation. Instead, your mindset should be: “What does this person know, that invalidates something I thought was true?”\\nIf you’ve set out to confirm your ideas, not to disconfirm, then you will easily see the confirmation and conveniently miss the disconfirmation, and you will have done worse than waste your time—you have convinced yourself to believe incorrect assumptions.\\nThis process is a specific way to achieve that outcome: Maximizing genuine learning.\\n\\n\\n\\nListening is being able to be changed by the other person.\\n—Alan Alda\\n\\n\\nThe Process \\n1. Goals: What you’re trying to learn \\nWhat is it that you’re trying to learn? If it’s a new product at a new company, in a B2B space, where the fundamental value-proposition is to solve some specific existing customer pain-point, the list should include everything standing between the customer’s problem and your potential product; a list might be something like:\\n\\nWhat does the “perfect customer” (PC) look like?\\nWhat outcomes does PC need to deliver in a typical month?  (e.g. JTBD framework)\\nWhat does PC actually do in a typical day?  (e.g. tools, workflows, things they love, things they dread)\\nWhat pain points does PC experience today?  (i.e. what actually happens, and what pain does the customer actually know about?)\\nHow does PC cope with that pain today?  (i.e. what is your competition, including DIY?)\\nHow much would PC pay to eliminate that pain? How is PC able to budget and execute the payment?  (i.e. what are viable prices and terms?)\\nWhat is the triggering moment? What causes PC to decide: Today’s the day I’m going to buy something?  (because no one randomly switches vendors)\\nWhat causes PC to resist or fear buying?  (habits of the present, anxiety of change, risk or cost of implementation)\\nWhere does PC go to discover and buy products like this?  (i.e. what are the best distribution channels?)\\nWhat specific words does PC use to talk about the space; what tacit assumptions does PC have?  (i.e. how should you talk about the product?)\\nWhat ultimate, higher-level goal does PC have?  (i.e. what outcomes are they expecting as a byproduct?)\\n\\nDecide on your list of goals first, as they will drive the content of your interviews.\\nNotice what is not here: Asking the customer what to build, or whether would buy some feature.\\nThis has happened to me dozens of times in my 24-year career: Asked a customer “Would you buy if we build ______?” and then say “Yes” and then we build it and then they don’t buy. Every seasoned Product Manager will regale you with the same story. Here’s where we trot out the Henry Ford quote: “If I asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said ‘a faster horse.’” Except sometimes “a faster horse” is a wonderful product and a successful startup. And sometimes you should invent a car. In neither case can you find out by talking to customers.\\nInstead, what you can learn from talking to customers, is what their current life is like, which answers the many import questions listed above, leading someday to something with Product/Market Fit.\\n2. Hypotheses: What you currently think the answers are \\nIt sounds funny to write down the answers to these questions ahead of time; after all, the whole point of interviewing is to empirically discover the answers, not presume you already have them! “Learning” and all that.\\nThe first reason to do this comes from the literature on the science of predictions. Specifically, people are much better and more objective at seeking the truth when they’re forced to record their predictions—for example as formal “bets”—and observe how reality confirms or clashes with those bets. We all autonomically retcon our beliefs in the presence of new information, or just discard the new information (i.e. Confirmation Bias). Writing our predictions down helps us avoid these fallacies.\\nThe second reason to write down hypotheses is that they will lead us to great questions for the interview.\\nCreate hypotheses for each of your goals. At least one per goal, but more is fine. It’s also fine to have hypotheses that aren’t attached to a goal, but you’re really curious anyway.\\nHere’s an example list of hypotheses I had about WordPress hosting in 2009 before I started WP Engine; I’ve added a “mapping” to the goal-list above:\\n\\n[G1,G4] Bloggers with more than 100,000 page-views per month have trouble keeping their blog fast.\\n[G1,G4] Bloggers with more than 10,000 RSS subscribers have traffic bursts that take down their site, even if the functions just fine under normal conditions.\\n[G4] All WordPress bloggers worry about getting hacked, because it’s common knowledge that blogs get hacked constantly.\\n[G3] Serious bloggers spend at least 3 hours per day inside WordPress—whether writing or answering comments.\\n[G3] Serious bloggers spend at least 2 hours per week on IT tasks related to hosting.\\n[G5,G6] Some bloggers spend thousands of dollars on consultants to make blogs fast and scalable.\\n[G5] Some bloggers just live with the problems.\\n[G1,G6] A blogger with 50,000 page-views per month will pay $50/mo if these named problems go away.\\n[G6] Bloggers use personal credit cards to buy supporting software for their blog.\\n[G6] Bloggers need to try software before they’re comfortable buying.\\n[G7] When bloggers get hacked, it’s a traumatic moment in which they say “I never want that to happen again,” and they’re ready to switch hosting providers.\\n[G8] Scary, unclear, expensive to move all your data; what if you get there and it doesn’t work?\\n[G9] Bloggers read blogs-about-blogging for tips.\\n[G9] Bloggers trust the advice of WordPress consultants.\\n[G2] Bloggers care about driving RSS subscribers more than anything else, because those are repeat viewers.\\n[G2] Serious bloggers publish at least four times per week, to stoke page views for advertisements, reader interest, and Google search results.\\n[G10] Bloggers call themselves “bloggers,” not writers, authors, content-marketers, etc..\\n[G10] Bloggers call their website a “blog,” not a “website.”\\n\\nEven if you don’t know anything about “blogging in 2009,” I’ll bet this set of theories sounds reasonable to you. So reasonable, that maybe you’d presume it’s not worth spending lots of time validating them.\\nBut you’d be wrong. (And so was I. We’re all wrong, at the beginning.) After dozens of hours of interviews, I found that half of these hypotheses were wrong. The ones that were correct still needed to be tuned in detail. And equally valuably, I discovered additional attitudes and behaviors that weren’t in my original list.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance. It’s the illusion of knowledge.\\n—Stephen Hawking\\n\\n\\nFor example: It’s not true that most people are willing to pay extra for extra security. It turns out that selling security to bloggers is like selling backup software: If you’ve never had a hard drive failure, it’s unlikely you’ll pay $30/mo for a backup service. Once you experience that devastating event, the first thing you do with your new laptop is sign up for any service that promises 100% full automatic backup. (Selling security to mid-sized companies is different; by then, they’re proactively executing a formal policy.)\\nAnother example: While it is true that bloggers want to “try before you buy” for most software (whether “trial” or “freemium”), this was not the case with hosting their website. It’s such a disruption and technical ordeal to move their website to a new vendor, they think of it as permanent, not temporary. Therefore, “free trial” is not the most compelling offer, whereas “free migrations” is. By the way, we tried “free trial” anyway—how can people not love a free trial!—but the conversion rate was over 90%, and when we removed the free trial, signups didn’t decrease at all.\\nIt’s important to list even the most obvious, mundane assumptions, because you’ll be surprised how often you’re wrong or they need adjustment, even if you’re an expert in the field.\\nPut these hypotheses in the first column of a spreadsheet, one per row.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n3. Questions: What you ask during the interview \\nGenerating good questions is the hard part for most people. Armed with your hypotheses, however, it becomes easy, if you adhere to the following system.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to want to know.\\n—Clayton Christensen\\n\\n\\nQuestions are designed to test your hypotheses, and to suggest better ones. To achieve this, go to the second column in your spreadsheet, and write one question per hypothesis. Sometimes one question can cover a few hypotheses, if they’re closely related.\\nQuestions must be open-ended. This is where most people go wrong. They’ll have a hypothesis like the “security” example above, so they’ll ask a question that “leads the witness,” because they’re still in “selling” mode instead of “discovery” mode:\\n\\nBlogs get hacked all the time, and when they do it’s devastating, right? Would you like it if your hosting company had extra security measures to protect your blog?\\n\\nOf course everyone will say “yes.” Why not? I’d sound dumb if I didn’t agree. That’s why it’s a useless question. You didn’t find out what the person actually thinks. And therefore you didn’t find out what everyone else will think when they look at your advertisement or arrive on your home page or review your pricing page. The assumption baked into your question could be wrong, and now you’ll never know.\\nInstead, write open-ended questions that:\\n\\nConfirm or negate the hypothesis (the point of the exercise)\\nDo not hint at any one specific answer (seek unbiased truth)\\nInvite the generation a specific answer (uncover the correct answer)\\nInvite more information (seek answers to questions you didn’t know to ask)\\n\\nOn “security,” for example:\\n\\nDo you ever think about website security? If so, how do you think about that? Do you do anything about it today?\\n\\nHere’s more examples from the hypotheses above:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHypothesis\\nBad Question\\nGood Question\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBloggers call themselves “bloggers.”\\nDo you consider yourself a “blogger?”\\nWhen you meet someone new, how do you explain what you do in a few sentences?\\n\\n\\nSerious bloggers publish at least four times per week.\\nDo you publish often, so Google ranks you high in SEO and there’s a lot of surface area for people to find you?\\nHow often do you publish new content? Why at that rate—what led you to that decision?\\n\\n\\nSome bloggers spend thousands of dollars on consultants to make blogs fast and scalable\\nWould you spend $2000 on a consultant, if it meant your blog would become much faster and more scalable, so you rank higher on Google search results and get more traffic?\\nHow valuable is the speed of your website? Have you ever spent money to improve it? If so, how much, and what did you do? Did it work? Were you happy with that investment?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Iterate the hypotheses \\nDuring the interview, take notes in the spreadsheet, in a new column, next to each question (which in turn is next to each hypothesis). The conversion might deviate from the original point; that’s OK, maybe straying will lead to learning new things.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most exciting phrase in science isn’t “eureka,” but rather, “that’s funny.\\n—Isaac Asimov\\n\\n\\nIf you hear anything surprising, ask follow-up questions. Surprise means you’re learning, and since “learning” is the whole point of the exercise, you should use “surprise” as a signal that you should dig deeper. You can use an old interviewing trick: Just say: “Tell me more about that.”\\nAfter each interview, consider what supported or contradicted your hypotheses. Should you alter some of them? Not necessarily, especially after just a few interviews, but definitely if you’re seeing a pattern.\\nAlso create new hypotheses (and associated questions) based on new learnings. The more insight you can get about your potential customers, the better. Don’t worry about whether every hypothesis maps cleanly onto one of your goals; just accumulate insight.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you’ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you’ve made a discovery\\n—Enrico Fermi\\n\\n\\n5. Stop when it’s boring \\nDo you have all the right answers? Who knows. Probably not. But when this method stops producing new information, then you need a new method for making progress. That could be a proof-of-concept, a high-fidelity demo, an MVP (or actually an SLC), or something else.\\nWhen the surprises stop, that means learning has stopped, and that means you should stop the process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA typical mistake is to do three interviews, and then stop because “I’m not learning anything.” With so little input, you might not be genuinely seeking to learn. That’s like a marketer saying “I tried two variants of my AdWords ad, and none of them are better than my first attempt, so I’m not going to try any more variants.”\\nIt’s also possible there’s nothing to learn because you’re fishing in the wrong spot. Maybe there’s no patterns because you haven’t found a real pain-point that more than a few people have and are willing to pay for. That means you need different ideas.\\nHere’s more detail on how to determine whether the result of customer interviews is telling you “don’t pursue this idea.”\\nMaximizing your results \\nSo that’s the whole process.\\nHere are more tips.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nEmergent segmentation \\nYou might notice that customers are segmented. Meaning, a certain type of customer tends towards one set of answers, while another has a different set. In the case of security, for example, when you talk to marketing departments at large companies, they do think about security, whereas when you talk to independent bloggers, they almost never do.\\nIn this case, it’s useful to make a note of the segments you think exist. First, write hypotheses and questions that you believe are the determining characteristics of the segments. You’ll ask these at the top of the call. Then, keep separate spreadsheets of hypotheses, one per segment. If you’re lucky, you’ll end up with clarity on the types of customers, and what each are like. You might choose to target one, some, or all of these; regardless, understanding the landscape is invaluable.\\nDiscuss price \\nThis one is controversial; many intelligent people insist that you shouldn’t discuss price in early customer interviews because it unnecessarily conflates financial considerations with the discovery of customer attitudes, behavior, and pain-points.\\nBut in my opinion the price-tag is an essential component of the interview, because I believe the price is inextricably linked to what the product means to that person, therefore how they think about it and how it affects their life. Price also determines the business model of the company, so it should not be “figured out later.”\\nIn early interviews for WP Engine, near the end of the call I would float a price of $50/mo for a service that made their website faster, more scalable, more secure, and came with genuinely good customer service. The responses were immediate, emotional, and vehement. One group was shocked—shocked—that the price tag would be so high; they would never pay even close to that amount. Another group said they would only buy the service if it were much more expensive, because otherwise they know it couldn’t possibly fulfill its promises. (Those groups turned out to be emergent segments; see above.)\\nHad I not discussed price, I would never have learned about the segmentation, or the expectations behind those segments, and thus how to price correctly, and for whom.\\nI had another startup concept before WP Engine. Insights stemming from pricing discussions was one of the primary ways I was able to invalidate that idea, which in turn created the space for WP Engine, which is now a unicorn.\\nPricing questions can be open-ended (i.e. “How much would you expect to pay for …”), however I think quoting a specific price is an acceptable breach of protocol. Putting a specific price in front of people elicits a strong, visceral response. When someone actually visits your pricing page in future, this is also the experience they will have—reacting to a specific price. It’s smart to test what that experience will be like.\\nYou can also tie pricing questions into your other questions, to test whether the person really values that topic. For example, another way to test the hypothesis that bloggers care about security would be:\\n\\nWould you pay extra for a security package that really worked, or do you not really worry about being singled out for getting attacked by a hacker?\\n\\nBy asking if they’d pay extra, and by almost suggesting that they shouldn’t bother, you’re testing whether they really ascribe value to the concept. This worked in practice—most bloggers initially claimed security was important to them, but admitted they wouldn’t pay extra to have more of it.\\nExpect contradictions \\nYou’re going to get all sorts of contradictory signals. People are different. Sometimes because they have different goals, different values, different past experiences, different roles, different projects, or for no discernible reason whatsoever. So your data is going to be noisy.\\nSome of your hypotheses will end up reflecting the variation. You might conclude that some number varies a lot rather than staying in a small range, or that there is no pattern in people’s opinions about some topic. That’s still learning: Knowing what patterns don’t exist prevents you from making false assumptions.\\nReal patterns will stand out from that noise; that’s your fundamental truth, that you can build products and strategies around. There might not be much of it. All the more reason to highlight it.\\nAsk them to explain, step-by-step, how they will use it. \\nThe pattern: You ask a customer if they have the problem; they do. You ask whether they’d buy your product to solve it; they say yes. Then you build it, and they don’t buy. Somehow, your interrogation didn’t work.\\nSales conversions are never 100%, but one technique is to ask them to describe, in painstaking detail, exactly how they will use the product in their daily life. When would they open it up, how does it fit into their workflow, which features do they invoke, how do they move the outputs into other systems?\\nThis works because while they really do mean “yes, I think that sounds good,” thinking it through uncovers barriers that in fact blocks the sale; it turns out they need it to integrate better with something, or they actually need a feature you weren’t contemplating, or some other hiccup.\\nEveryone “knows” what everyone else wants, except they don’t \\nI don’t think I’ve ever conducted a customer interview where the interviewee didn’t switch into “market guru” mode. This is where the customer stops talking about her own life, her own problems, what features or price tag would be acceptable to her, and starts talking on behalf of other people.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t pay $50/mo, but a lot of people would.”\\n“I would pay $50/mo, but most people would expect this to be free.”\\n“I care about security, but most people are completely clueless about that.”\\n“Well I use a free tool to do that, but most people don’t.”\\n\\nOf course it’s coming from a good place—they want to help you, they want to explain the “state of the market,” they want to leverage their expertise. But they don’t know what everyone else wants.\\nNeither do you; that’s why you’re doing these interviews. And when you see all the crazy, different things people think, you realize that it takes tons of interviews to uncover even a modicum of truth. The person you’re interviewing hasn’t done that, so they don’t know the truth.\\nOne of the hallmarks of successful companies is that they found some untapped aspect of the market and owned it. That might be a feature no one had considered, or a technology that before now hadn’t been accessible, or a realization that the human touch trumps everything (Zappos) or that the human touch doesn’t matter at all (Geico). Even if the person you’re interviewing is a market expert, you’re specifically looking for interesting holes and niches that the experts haven’t noticed!\\nSo be polite, calmly tell them that’s great insight, reinterpret “everyone else wants X” to either mean “I want X” or just throw out the comment completely, and redirect the conversation back to themselves and their own specific situation.\\nLeveraging AI… maybe \\nAI might help. Perhaps it could…\\n\\nGenerate hypothesis from the goals, adhering to the guidelines, specifying which goal attaches to which hypothesis (although of course you’ll treat them as templates and correct them to what you actually believe).\\nGenerate questions for the hypothesis, specifying which question attaches to which hypothesis, adhering to the guidelines above.\\nClean up transcripts.\\nScan conversations for common themes.\\nScan conversations for “things that contradict a specific set of hypothesis.”\\nScan multiple conversations for themes.\\n\\nHowever, half the value of this exercise thinking through this stuff for yourself. The “aha” moments come only when you wrestle with the details.\\nYou find the contradictions. You discover maybe you didn’t think that after all. You realize new ideas that solve for the conflicting inputs. You realize which hypothesis are right, wrong, different.\\nSo, I advise you not to use AI, except to accelerate busywork such as:\\n\\nClean up transcripts so they occupy less space and are easier to process.\\nDouble-check your thinking after you do the thinking, maybe come up with new ideas.\\nSummarize your thinking, i.e. take your thinking that you wrote out or said aloud, and make the result pithy and clear.\\n\\nSTFU \\nIf you’re talking, you’re not learning. To maximize learning, minimize talking.\\nWhen you do talk, it should be because you’re clarifying your understanding about what they just said, digging deeper on the current conversation, or opening up a new vein of conversation.\\nFurther reading \\n\\n12 tips for customer development interviews (by Giff Constable, 2012, just as relevant today as then, wholly compatible with this process.)\\n11 Customer Development Anti-Patterns (also by Giff Constable, 2013; sometimes it’s easier to list what not to do.)\\nCustomer Interviews: Get Actionable Insights from Every Interview (Comprehensive advice from Teresa Torres, also the author of the fantastic book Continuous Discovery Habits that also explains what to do with the information you get from interviews.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/customer-development/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe Iterative-Hypothesis customer development method\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)The goal is to uncover the truth, not to sellThe Process1.

The economist claims that any transaction is evidence that WTP > Price, and the difference between those numbers is “Consumer Surplus.”\\nIt looks trivial at a first glance, but I’ve come to believe that analyzing “WTP” is not only non-trivial, but also leads to very different strategies, business models, and outcomes.\\n“Willingness” to pay \\nI’m irked by this word “willingness.”\\nIn 2015, Martin Shkreli, then-CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the rights to the drug Daraprim, which for 62 years had been used to treat a deadly parasitic disease. He raised the price of a pill from $13 to $750, skyrocketing the typical cost of treatment from $1,000 to $63,000.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nMartin Shkreli testifying before congress on a hearing on drug prices, before calling lawmakers “imbeciles”\\n\\n\\n“Profit” was his only justification for this abuse, in his own words:\\n\\n“I think it will be huge…. So 5,000 paying bottles at the new price is $375,000,000—almost all of it is profit, and I think we will get 3 years of that or more. Should be a very handsome investment for all of us.” —Martin Shkreli, in communication with investors\\n\\nPatients have no choice: It’s pay or die. The economist would say, patients objectively have a high “willingness” to pay. But is this how we should define “willing?”\\nAnd when patients cannot afford a $63,000 treatment, and therefore don’t purchase the drug, and die, should we say “well, I suppose they weren’t ‘willing’ to pay?” This phrase captures neither the intent nor the ability to pay, both of which are critical factors in questions of price, profit, and consumer surplus.\\nWhile there are many1 such examples, it’s more instructive to point out mundane, non-life-threatening examples of why “willing” is not the right word.\\n\\n1\\n There were at least four egregious cases in 2015 alone. More recently, Moderna quadrupled the price of their COVID vaccines, its CEO Stephane Bancel saying that the new price is “consistent with the value” of mRNA vaccines at 45 times the manufacturing cost, after the US government paid them billions to cover the cost of developing the drug. Are we “willing” to pay even more? “Yes” in the sense that human life is valuable, but “no” in the usual sense of the word “willing.“\\nIt happens with commodities, which economists say are a “perfect market.” When crude oil prices go up, prices at the pump go up immediately, even though costs haven’t yet risen. When crude oil prices go down, prices at the pump go down slowly, even after costs have in fact fallen. The same thing is happening now with eggs. Is that because we’re all “willing” to over-pay for gas and eggs?\\nIt happens with bundling—often touted as a wonderful strategy. I never liked paying for cable TV, because it seemed expensive considering I still had to watch ads all the time. Most of the channels I paid for, I didn’t watch. Cable companies know that of course; they bundle channels specifically because they know consumers are not “willing” to pay for all of them. Because the content-owners have a near-monopoly, consumers have no choice. Even with modern streaming services the problem persists, because whether it’s Hulu Live or YouTube TV, it’s still bundled, and still the same price.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s also “willing” versus “able.” Perhaps many more consumers would be “willing” to pay $1000 for a fully tricked-out smartphone, but most are not “able.” This is vital fact when determining strategy, business models, and company viability, but an economist would just say “few consumers are ‘willing’ to pay $1000 for a high-end phone.”\\nBut it’s not all bogus. There is a genuine concept of being “willing” to pay more, and thus genuine “Customer Surplus.” I am willing to pay more for Anker products (power strips and chargers) because they’re extremely high-quality; I don’t even notice if there’s a competing product that is 20% cheaper. I’m loyal even though there is neither lock-in nor recurring revenue. People pay more for TOMS2 and Patagonia3 products because of the authentic missions of the companies. People routinely pay more for coffee that has a fair and sustainable supply-chain, because they’re truly willing to pay more to have a positive impact on the world, not just to consume the product.\\n\\n2\\n Blake Mycoskie was vacationing in Argentina, when a knowledgable American opened his eyes to the outsized impact that a lack of shoes has on poor children. Unprotected feet are susceptible to punctures and infection, and prohibit walking long distances, which in turn means one cannot go to school. He founded TOMS shoes, selling an Argentinian-style shoe, with the logo of the Argentinian flag, with a marketing strategy he dubbed One for One: Every time you buy a pair of shoes, TOMS would give a pair to a needy child. After TOMS’s financial success, Sketchers copied the strategy exactly, even down to the style of the shoe, the name (“BOBS”), and the altruism. Consumers were so outraged by this inauthentic strategy, Sketchers was forced to canceled the product line after just 24 hours (although they revived the brand later with a different mission). That strategy was individual to TOMS; it was irrelevant that the strategy was publicly visible and copy-able. TOMS has weaknesses—people complain about poor customer service and shoes quickly developing holes—but they win anyway on the strength of the individualized story.\\n3\\n Besides their publicly-lauded sustainable practices and an outdoor-worshipping culture, they even have a formal company policy to bail employees out of jail if arrested while protesting peacefully.\\nIndeed, genuine “willingness” creates the best, most durable, most profitable businesses. Consumers not only pay more, they’re happy to pay more, creating profit margin. They become evangelists, driving efficient growth. The company is resilient to competition, because consumers are buying for reasons other than “features” and “price.” The world becomes a better place, transcending a zero-sum game of winners and losers.\\nAnalyzing the differences between these kinds of WTP yields insights that all products and companies can leverage to build the best strategies.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nThree kinds WTP \\nI divide WTP into three categories, each having different drivers, and much different strategic value:\\nLove \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMission: the joy of supporting a change that’s bigger than all of us, or a community or movement you want to see flourish\\nReciprocity: when the company gives before taking, or gives more than it takes, or provides exceptional customer service\\nExceptional design: a joy to use, a product that seems to genuinely care about your experience\\nExceptional quality: the pleasure and relief generated by reliability\\nPersonal identification: leveraging the company’s brand as visible component of your own personal brand\\nCulture: supporting an organization that treats employees and vendors well4\\nSocial or environmental impact: supporting sustainable, fair practices\\nCommunity: a welcoming space where members learn and teach, support each other, create personal connections, grow their career or business, be part of a tribe\\nEcosystem: wherein all members make more money or gain more prestige than had they not been part of the group\\n\\nResult: Allyship. Consumers are genuinely happy to do business with you, and root for your success; when you make a profit, they cheer, because they want you to thrive; they advocate for you publicly5, tying their personal brand with yours; they don’t even consider the competition; the old saying that “people buy from the person they like;” they would be OK with a small price-increase.\\n\\n4\\n Counter-example: Walmart and Amazon, known for exploiting workers and suppliers\\n5\\n This single tweet demonstrates this with thousands of responses.\\nUtility \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCheap: even if quality and functionality is low, it’s better than not having the product\\nIntegrations: providing functionality while also more difficult to switch vendors\\nSystem-of-record: being the official place for important data, making it risky and expensive to switch vendors\\nTraining: invested in having trained an organization, making it expensive and disruptive to switch vendors\\nMarket-share Leader: the social-proof of selecting the market-leader is a reason to buy\\nLocation: coffee inside the airport is more expensive than on the street corner\\nConvenience: groceries delivered to your doorstep are substantially more expensive than getting them yourself\\nSimplicity: surprising ease is as delightful as it is useful\\nQuality: a seamless experience with no defects is often worth paying for\\nRisk-reduction: mitigating potential problems is difficult to measure, but valuable\\nUnique functionality: a capability that no competitor can match is a sensible criterium for a purchase decision\\nOn-boarding experience: data shows that ease and reciprocity results in higher WTP\\nFamiliarity: having used a product or a workflow paradigm for years, it is the comfortable way to work\\n\\nResult: Fair exchange of value. Your product is useful and not excessively painful; the “devil we know;” getting your money’s worth; easier to stay than to leave, and no particular desire to leave.\\nCoercion \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContract lock-in: retaining your business through paperwork rather than by choice\\nData lock-in: retaining your business by holding your data hostage rather than by choice\\nEffective monopoly: being the only feasible option6\\nEffective price-fixing: breaking the so-called “free market”\\nMiddle-man: placing yourself in the middle of a transaction, increasing consumer price while decreasing supplier’s profit7\\nBundle-stuffing: combining many things the customer doesn’t want with the few they do want, to charge more in total8\\nScale Anti-Pricing: raising prices once an installation is at-scale, knowing that although an alternative might be more effective, more desirable, and cheaper, the one-time cost of switching is incredibly high\\nPredatory Pricing: using lower-than-cost pricing to destroy competitors and ward off investors (funded by another business unit like Amazon does or by VCs as companies like Uber did), then increase prices once the competitive market has been decimated and customers have no choice.\\nPatents: abusing a system meant to temporarily protect inventions to block normal competition.\\nCorporate policy: once a product is written into a company’s formal policy (site-wide license or the only approved vendor for some application), that product “wins” even if every user hates it\\nGovernment fiat or regulation9\\n\\nResult: Adversarial. Customers want to leave; they idly comment that they wish some new competitor would arrive and disrupt you; they hate seeing your charges on their bill; they do business with you only begrudgingly; they lobby their boss to switch vendors.\\n\\n6\\n This can be constructed purposefully, e.g. Uber spending tens of billions of dollars subsidizing rides to drive rival taxi and ride-share services out of business, so that they are the only option, and can raise prices, as they now have done.\\n7\\n A classic example is the person who buys a bunch of tickets to a concert, then resells them at 10x the price after the concert is “sold out.” Here’s an even more appalling example.\\n8\\n There is also a positive version of bundling, in which the items are mostly things the customer does want, purchased at a discount over buying each item individually, possibly with some useful interoperability.\\n9\\n Here Uber is an example of “love,” breaking the “coercive” stranglehold of taxi industry regulations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of these things contribute equally to the economist’s definition of WTP: The customer is in fact paying, and might pay more if you raise prices. But strategically they are completely different.\\nEffect on growth and competitive pressure \\nLove creates inexpensive, non-linear growth, because your customers are your allies. \\nYou get repeat purchases, whether it’s a one-time revenue product or a loyal recurring-revenue customer. This creates growth with no additional marketing and sales costs.\\nYou get word-of-mouth advocacy. When someone asks what to buy on Twitter, your rabid fans answer the question. When there’s a review site, your product ranks number one. When Customer Surplus is enormous, consumers reciprocate by selling new customers on your behalf10. Once again, this is growth without additional marketing and sales costs. Furthermore, the effect grows as your customer base grows: A non-linear effect.\\nWhen a new competitor arrives, even when it is superior in features or price, your customers will stay, because they’re here for more than just the features and the price. This yields retention, which is another form of growth11. There is a limit to this effect of course—at some point the product simply isn’t good enough—but it carries you through the vacillations of typical competitive one-upmanship.\\n\\n10\\n Hollow Knight is a high-quality indie game, made primarily by just three people. Released in 2017, people still make YouTube videos about it in 2023. The soundtrack has millions of listens on Spotify. Everyone says it’s far too cheap at $15. Plus you get 4 expansion packs for free—something games normally charge for. Everyone repeats the story about how it’s just two guys plus one other guy who did the amazing music. Fans even begged them to charge more but they don’t—they’d rather be accessible, and people love them all more for it. The economist would say they should raise prices because they can. Yes they can, but it’s obvious that rabid fans generate millions of purchases, and that financial impact is so much larger than closing the WTP/Price gap to “demonstrate you have market power.“\\n11\\n Don’t believe me? Look at the growth curve of any startup that went from 7%/mo cancellation to 2%/mo.\\nUtility helps grow existing customers, and is neutral-to-positive on attracting new ones. \\nAs an organization grows, it will naturally buy more seats of software for teams in customer support, sales, engineering, and so on. It will naturally buy more infrastructure and incur more credit card transaction fees. This isn’t a negative, and does creates internal growth, which is a powerful growth-driver for any business, especially at scale12.\\nBut, a customer’s willingness to buy another ten seats of JIRA doesn’t imply the customer is going on forums, spending personal credibility to advocate on your behalf. And it doesn’t mean they won’t take a look at an interesting new competitor13.\\n\\n12\\n At scale, new customers can be added only so quickly, whereas you have an enormous existing customer base, so growth inside the base is a larger factor than growth from new customers.\\n13\\n Indeed, new JIRA competitor Linear has quickly amassed a rabid fanbase on the basis of exceptional UX. It’s easy to imagine JIRA users trying Linear and even advocating to switch, whereas it’s laughable to imagine a Linear user trying to convince their team to switch to JIRA.\\nCoercion causes your customers to be allied with competitors; they’re internally-motived to leave, so they will. \\n“Just give me an excuse.” Your customers, locked in against their will, cannot wait for a viable competitor to appear. They will go out of their way to switch, coming up with reasons why investing in the switch will pay for itself ten-fold, despite the cost. Exactly the case you don’t want your customers building.\\nWhen your contract is up for renewal, you should be very afraid. When someone asks on Twitter what tool they should use, your customers say: “Well we use X, but don’t make the same mistake!”\\nYou are constantly vulnerable to disruption, even by mediocre competition. This is the weakest position you could be in, because you’re coercing customers instead of delighting them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nProfit done right: Create more positive WTP, then split it with the customer \\n\\n“[When you increase WTP], you’re adding value for the consumer, and then figuring out how to split that with the consumer.”  —Michael Mauboussin, interviewed on the Invest like the Best podcast.\\n\\nCreating value for the customer comes first. Then—and only then—you can decide how to “split it with the customer,” either leveraging Consumer Surplus for advocacy, high-retention, and growth, or indeed by raising prices.\\nWhen you create that value through Love or Utility, this is both sustainable and profitable. When it’s through Coercion, it is temporary at best.\\nThe strongest organizations have all three. For example, Apple generates Love through appealing design, being a statement of personal brand, and maintaining the highest standard of privacy even if it means the product is less functional or interoperable. Apple also leverages utility, becoming familiar and convenient (and thus a mental effort to switch away), and trying to become the center of everything from family photos to shared files to 10,000 notes to the common way to purchase things, creating a form of “lock-in” that feels useful rather than evil. But it leverages Coercion as well, as users are locked-in even when they’d prefer not to be, unable to export data from apps like Notes, and being forced to buy new devices as older ones suspiciously stop working well after applying new (mandatory) operating system upgrades, and changing the connectors on charging cables every 5-10 years.\\nIn any case, Apple has increased WTP in all three ways over the past ten years, and they’ve split that with their customers, as evidenced by a consistent profit margin:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nApple’s net profit margin:\\nIf they were increasing prices faster than WTP, profits would have increased.\\n\\n\\nEven the cold-blooded capitalist should eschew Coercion \\nHere’s why Love and Utility results in more valuable companies, even though it prioritizes Consumer Surplus over profits:\\nImagine there are two companies, alike in every way: Same product, same industry, same market, same number of customers at the same price, at the same costs, and thus the same revenue, same profit, and same WTP. The only difference is:\\n\\nCompany’s WTP is generated only by Love.\\nCompany’s WTP is generated only by Coercion.\\n\\nWhich one is most likely to grow in volume and profit over the next five years? Which is more likely to capture more market share? In other words, which is the better investment for a Venture Capitalist?\\nI’d pick (1). I know their customer base will help them grow efficiently, while competitors look on helplessly, unable to convert customers even with the lure of unique features and lower prices. Whereas I know (2)’s customer base will be trying to leave, praying another competitor comes to save them, publicly warding away potential customers from repeating their mistake.\\nIt is also possible for (1) to add Utility or even Coercive WTP to their strategy, further strengthening their position, whereas it is much more difficult for (2) to generate Love starting from their current position. It’s not that Coercion is never an appropriate ingredient, but rather that the other two are better14.\\n\\n14\\n It’s like the Agile Manifesto: When it says “Working software over comprehensive documentation,” it isn’t saying “Documentation is bad.” Rather, it’s saying “Working software” is more valuable, so that’s where we should spend most of our energy.\\nLove beats Coercion, even as cold-blooded, money-grubbing capitalist investor, indifferent to ethics or the betterment of the world.\\nAnd yet Love makes money while in fact bettering the world, and making everyone happier.\\nSo choose Love by building it into your strategy, investing in it, and then reveling in what you’ve created.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\nAppendix: Relationship to other frameworks \\nYou can apply this concept directly to your strategy, and merge it with other techniques.\\nKano \\n“Love” feels a lot like Kano’s “Delight”—a joyous, perhaps even unexpected upside. “Utility” maps to “Performance”—where the more of it there is, the more value it is to the customer. “Coercive” maps to “Inverse”—something that customers actively dislike, even though you gain the selfish corporate benefit of retention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMoats \\nMany of these things sound like moats, and for good reason: Increasing WTP of any type increases your ability to capture and retain customers. The more forceful (whether positive or negative), the more that becomes a permanent advantage that others cannot dislodge. No one can take away a fantastic brand, and government fiat can last for decades.\\nAn interesting example is “network effect,” because it shows up in all three types:\\n\\n“Love” network effects include community and ecosystem, where participants help one another personally and professionally.\\nOne “Utility” network effect is a functioning marketplace, so e.g. eBay was for decades the destination having the greater number of buyers and sellers of collectable objects, and thus genuinely the most useful place to transact. You might not “love” eBay, but certainly people went there because it was useful, not because they were forced to.\\nOne “Coercive” network effect is when choice is limited to “preferred vendors,” creating a cartel rather than creating choice. For example, the United States health care system features insurance companies who each support their own network of doctors. A consequence is that switching insurance can mean you have to switch family doctors—an unnecessary and “value-destroying” activity as an economist would say.\\n\\nStart with “Why” \\n“Love” reinforces the Simon Sinek’s admonition that companies must “Start with Why,” i.e. understand and articulate its higher purpose, it’s mission, because when that’s strong and important, when it permeates everything from its market-positioning to its culture to its employees, it’s extremely powerful, and impossible for a competitor to destroy.\\nExample: Buffer has a relatively undifferentiated product and pays lower salaries than many people can get elsewhere, but their culture and transparency is second-to-none, and people want to be a part of that. Example: TruthSocial, which can’t pay salaries like Twitter, and doesn’t have the reach of Twitter, and has technical issues with downtime and slow innovation, nevertheless possesses a rabid fanbase because of the mission and community.\\nBlue Ocean Strategy: The six kinds of “buyer utility” \\nIn Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne highlight six ways in which you can deliver “value” to customers. These are a subset of the more general reasons why people are compelled to buy, but it’s useful to emphasize the cases where the customer is benefiting directly:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlue Ocean  Buyer Utility\\nWTP Category\\nCommentary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomer  Productivity\\nUtility\\nThis category is too broad; it is important to distinguish between “more value” and “less cost.” Both contribute to “productivity,” but it is an order of magnitude more important to increase value. It’s also important to define value.\\n\\n\\nSimplicity\\nUtility\\nIncluded above.\\n\\n\\nConvenience\\nUtility\\nIncluded above, in several forms; for example “location” is a specific kind of convenience.\\n\\n\\nRisk\\nUtility\\nIncluded above.\\n\\n\\nFun & Image\\nLove\\nIncluded above.\\n\\n\\nEnvironmental  Friendliness\\nLove\\nIncluded in a more expansive “social and environmental impact,” as nowadays (2023) it is more common for customers to make buying decisions on factors like Fairtrade, or purchasing from local or minority-owned business, or supporting businesses with specific values and public commitments, in addition to the idea of being friendly to the environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLong-term engagement metrics \\nMany products wish to “drive engagement.” Some point to Facebook as the pinnacle of “growth hacking,” driving up numbers, often slipping away from Utility (to say nothing of Love) and into Coercive tricks.\\nBut even at Facebook, solving for Utility over Coercion worked better. In a fascinating multi-year UX experiment, Facebook found that when they reduced the quantity of notifications (by keeping the quality high), it had the expected negative result on engagement: Customer satisfaction increased, but app usage decreased (because it was leading you back to the app less often). But, after a year, app usage actually increased and remained higher that it was before the change. Increasing genuine satisfaction created more engagement in the long run. They had to be patient to see the results; traditional “growth hacking” did not discover the best solution.\\n\\nMany thanks to John Doherty for contributing insights to early drafts.\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/willingness-to-pay/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWillingness-to-pay: Creating permanent competitive advantage, for the right reasons\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Traditional economics: WTP and Consumer Surplus“Willingness” to payThree kinds WTPLoveUtilityCoercionEffect on growth and competitive pressureProfit done right: Create more positive WTP, then split it with the customerEven the cold-blooded capitalist should eschew CoercionAppendix: Relationship to other frameworks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Don’t do that. These are the characteristics of great strategy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategy is: How we will win.\\nYou can debate the form a strategy should take, whether a four-sentence “master plan” or a few dozen bullets or a six-pager or an eighty-pager or a template like Salesforce’s V2MOM or a Notion template you found on the Internet or answering three questions from a Twitter pundit or some sort of “Canvas.” Regardless, its job is to communicate “how we will win.”\\nThere are a lot of documents titled “Strategy,” but very little great strategy. The formula for great strategy isn’t decided by the format of the output document.\\n\\n\\n\\nGreatness needs luck, but it’s never by accident.\\n—Unknown\\n\\n\\nFor strategy to correctly determine and communicate “how we will win,” it must tackle the reality of complex systems, it must parry the follies while exploiting the strengths of human nature, and it must justify and spell out the decisions which lead to the desired outcome.\\nGreat strategies accomplish this with the following characteristics:\\n\\nSimple: Reshapes complexity to be manageable and actionable.\\nCandid: Dares to spotlight the most difficult truths.\\nDecisive: Asserts clear decisions and accepts their consequences.\\nLeveraged: Magnifies strengths into durable competitive advantage.\\nAsymmetric: Defeats uncertainty with higher upside than downside.\\nFuturistic: Solves for the long-term.\\n\\nWithout these qualities, the so-called “strategy” is at best a plan; at worst, it’s wishful thinking masquerading as “vision.”\\n\\nSimple \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSimple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.\\n—Steve Jobs\\n\\n\\nThe world is complex, and therefore difficult to reason about. Strategy intentionally omits detail in exchange for clarity. Armed with a simple narrative, mere mortals can achieve understanding, and make every-day decisions that remain aligned to that narrative.\\nNo one reads anything. You’re in the Top 1% just for reading this sentence. No one remembers anything. Certainly not an 86-slide PowerPoint1. So the strategy has to be simple—even simplistic—to have a chance at being read or remembered.\\n\\n1\\n Long supporting documents are useful, because they explain and justify complex topics, inspiring conviction even in people who don’t read it but are impressed by its size. Even the famously pithy Tesla “Master Plan” strategy consisting of just 39 words was preceded by 1200 words of justification.\\nPeople are mired their day to day work; only when the strategy is simple, does it have a chance of being incorporated. Only when the context is over-simplified, having made scrutable the complexity of the real world, can we easily explain “why,” and retell those stories in our weekly meetings and prioritization sessions. Those are the places where strategy lives and breathes, where teams can move quickly, independently, fulfilling their individual missions with a minimum of coordination, yet all supporting a common theory for how we will win, together.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bigger the project, the more we need a reminder of the goal, and simple things to execute today.\\n—Warren Buffett, shareholder letter, 1982\\n\\n\\nIf the strategy is simple, it might appear obvious. If it is obvious, it might appear uninsightful. Humans assume that complex puzzles require complex answers, when in fact often the simplest answer is the best answer2. “Obviousness” is a sign of a strategy that not only is easy to communicate and execute, but also believed.\\n\\n2\\n See, for example, the Midwit Fallacy, or how small sets of equations explain a wide range of physical phenomena.\\nIts job isn’t to be non-obvious, but rather to cleanly specify what is most important. It might be obvious to do X, but Y and Z are also “obvious,” so by selecting X and not Y nor Z, you have created focus, and specified “how to win.”\\nSimplicity at its worst becomes reductive—overlooking complexity rather than tackling it, resulting in conclusions that, while admittedly simple and clear, are wrong. We cannot pretend that complex problems can always be waved away by simple statements. The process of strategy creation must indeed tackle the complexity of the world, but the output of that process is a document that frees everyone else from having to re-solve every puzzle. Like a street map, we omit detail in exchange for clarity of the most important context and routes. Simplicity that ignores reality is reductive, but simplicity that arises from an exceptional summarization of having already processed the messy, complex world, is elegant.\\nCharacterizing the world in a few, simple, clear assertions, and solving our challenges with a few, clear directives of what we must do, is required for a strategy to be “how we will win.”\\nExample: The most famous sports coaches seem to credit their success to a few simple principles. They must be simple for a team to remember them, especially when they’re tired and battered near the end of a game, as in this description of the mentor of one of America’s most famous football coaches:\\n\\n“Blaik’s signature talent was using all this data to create something clean and simple. He had what Lombardi called “the great knack” for knowing what offensive plan to use against what defense, and the “discarding the immaterial and going with the strength.” All the detailed preparations resulted not in a mass of confusing statistics and plans, but in the opposite, paring away the extraneous, reducing and refining until all that was left was what was needed for that game against that team. It’s a lesson Lombardi never forgot.\\n—David Maraniss, When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi, 1999\\n\\n\\nCandid \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee, and don’t be afraid to see what you see.\\n—Ronald Reagan\\n\\n\\nStrategy must lay bare the most frightening, embarrassing realities. It must face the truth that we all avoid facing during the struggle of daily work.\\nIf the strategy doesn’t expose—and then solve—the most brutal facts, the strategy is wrong.\\nIn particular, the strategy must diagnose the primary challenges facing the business, even if the facts are so scary that it seems hopeless. Existential threats are the most important to articulate.\\nToo often a strategy claims “threats” that are lazy, generic, non-actionable pseudo-concerns that nearly every company could claim, like “Google could copy us” or “A new startup could invent a great product and get huge funding” or “A massive security breach could cause half our customers to leave.” Real threats are either happening now or are at least 70% likely to happen. Real threats are specific, ideally backed by data that proves they are happening, e.g. your market is shrinking; a competitor has accelerating market share; cancellation rates prove that even paying customers don’t value the product. Real threats are written in the present tense because they are happening, not hypothetically with “could” or “might.”\\nWhen the puzzles are clear, everyone can help solve them. When the puzzles remain hidden, what’s the chance that they’ll be solved by accident?\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage players want to be left alone. Good players want to be coached. Great players want the coach to tell them the truth.\\n—Nick Saban (won more US national college football titles than any other coach)\\n\\n\\nIf you’re worried someone might leave the company when they hear how scary it is, maybe they should leave the company. These are the challenges we’re facing together; if they’re not willing to solve them, they need to make space for someone who will relish the challenge. Not just for the company’s sake but for their own happiness and fulfillment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacing the truth, being specific about current reality and about what needs to be done, is required for a strategy to be “how we will win.”\\nExample: In a story retold here, originally from Jim Collins’s book Good to Great, A&P and Kroger were successful grocery stores in the 1960s who both possessed the data showing that their business models were becoming obsolete. They each discovered the new, correct business model through real-world experimentation, but only Kroger was willing to face that truth and change their strategy. Despite being half the size of A&P, Kroger increased its value 100-fold, while A&P shrank, then went bankrupt.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\nDecisive \\nA strategy asserts a set of justified, self-consistent decisions, such as:\\n\\nWhich subsets of the market to target  …and conversely which we’ll ignore, even if some of those sign up as customers anyway, and ask for things we’re not going to do, and then cancel in anger\\nWhich customer personas are most important to delight  …and conversely which will dislike our product, causing us no dismay, whose feature-requests we will quickly close as “won’t do” rather than wring our hands at all the features we still need to build\\nHow to position against the competition  …and conversely where the competition will be stronger, unlike those fake-news marketing charts comparing our product with the competition, where only our product scores 100% along every dimension\\nWhat we value (e.g. quality, service, speed, design, compatibility, lock-in)  …and conversely what we will give up, e.g. releasing features faster but of lower quality, or being infinitely extensible versus top-to-bottom thoughtful design\\nWhat we must (and must not) build, to pay off that positioning and win those customers in that market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can do anything, but not everything.\\n—David Allen\\n\\n\\nThere are both positive and negative second-order consequences of any complex decision. If these aren’t identified—in particular, if the problematic consequences aren’t embraced within the strategy—then it’s not a clear decision. When those consequences inevitably arise, the team must be able to say “we expected that” rather than “we have to address that” or even “this is a signal that the strategy is wrong.”\\nOne decision in every strategy is what market and customer-segment the company will target. Customers outside that target segment will inevitably buy anyway. Then they’ll complain about missing features, awkward UX workflows, missing integrations, high prices, and more. Then you’ll log those complaints into the bug-tracker and product-management Miro boards and start prioritizing, whereas in fact these ideas should be ignored so that the team can focus on winning the target customers. This is difficult to remember when the non-target customers complain on Twitter, supply low NPS scores, drag down your average star-rating on review sites, and cancel at high rates. Only with a strategy that has clearly articulated not only the decisions, but also the negative consequences of those decisions, can everyone stay true to those decisions even when emotions are running high and paying customers are canceling.\\nA common tactic for avoiding making a decision is to use non-specific language. “We will leverage synergies to create unique solutions” is, in fact, a good thing to do, but it doesn’t specify which synergies to leverage, what is unique about it, or what the unique solution is. Fluffy language is a hallmark of indecisiveness, and therefore of bad strategy.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategy is a set of interrelated and powerful choices that positions the organization to win.\\n—Roger Martin\\n\\n\\nDecisions and consequences must at minimum be self-consistent. If you’ve decided to have a low price, you can’t also have white-glove service. If you’ve decided that everything requires high-quality design, you can’t also release features faster than the competition. Or, perhaps you can creatively build a solution that does say “yes to both” of those things, but only by also accepting additional constraints that resolve the conflict.\\nBetter than “self-consistent” is “mutually-reinforcing.” This means that one decision makes another more powerful, or easier, or less expensive, and vice versa, so that adhering to both makes you far stronger than having only one. For example, deciding to have only a few features, and also amazing design. Normally customers might not put up with less functionality, but if the design experience is exceptional, they might be happy with something that “does only a few things, but so delightfully!” And vice versa: It’s easier to execute on great design when you don’t have to tackle a complex product with tons of use-cases and personas and functionality. At the end of this article, you’ll find a complete, powerful example of mutually-reinforcing decisions creating a durable (60-years!) competitive advantage.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.\\n—Warren Buffett\\n\\n\\nYou know the decisions are strong when they—and their consequences—cause you to say “no” to most things, including things which otherwise sound reasonable. An example of a strategy that makes a decision but also accepts negative consequences can be found at the end of this article about Moats; an example of how to make sales pitches while accepting negative consequences can be found in this article; several examples of how YouTube used a single, strong decision with multiple major downstream consequences are detailed in this article.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a strategy has articulated clear decisions, including the major consequences, especially accepting the negative consequences, causing us to say “no” to pretty-good ideas in order to make room for the very-best ideas, and to ignore the wishes of paying customers if they’re not the target paying customers, it is truly prescribing “how we will win.”\\nExample: Craig’s List is classified ads on the Internet. Their strategy includes crisp decisions like valuing consistent user experience more than great design (the website looks like it’s from 1995, because it is), and user-accessibility over monetization (“Craigslist president Jim Buckmaster has stated that creating a superior user experience is more important to the company than making money [source]”). The strategy is clear and differentiated, which should be seen as a strength, but it has bothered pundits for twenty-five years, who have therefore predicted its demise: “The main obstacle to sustainability and growth at Craigslist is likely the company’s and its founder’s strong principles valuing customer-offering over monetization, trusting consistency over innovation. Although admirable in many ways, the issue is that without innovation, the company’s customer-offering will soon no longer be strong enough to stay relevant, undermining its very well-intended purpose.\"—HBS. But crisp decisions make for a great strategy, even if controversial. Despite that well-reasoned death-sentence from HBS, despite others pointing out that dozens of successful companies have made sections of Craig’s List theoretically obsolete, despite data that predicts Craig’s List “demise”, despite protestations that Craig’s List could be a “gold mine of revenue, if only it would abandon its communist manifesto,” (i.e. if only it would abandon its strategy), it continues to be one of the most-visited sites in America, with revenues of $1,000,000,000 in 2020 with a staff of just fifty people, even after twenty-five years of Internet evolution.\\n\\nLeveraged \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe yourself. Everyone else is taken.\\n—Oscar Wilde\\n\\n\\nIf Sandra is a great singer, and Peter is a great pianist, then a good idea for a duet would be for Sandra to sing and Peter to play piano. A bad idea would be the other way around. Great strategy leverages the strengths and assets of the organization; a bad strategy asks the organization to win even while acting unnaturally, often under the cover of “overcoming weaknesses.”\\n“Leverage” means generating a large effect from a relatively small effort, where time and dollars are far more effective than one might expect, because we are riding tailwinds of natural abilities or hard-won assets, rather than fighting a battle against so-called “weaknesses.” You know you’re leveraging strengths when you see other people shake their heads in amazement at how much you accomplished in so little time.\\nIt’s good to leverage strengths. Much literature on strategy dwells on how to create moats—permanent competitive advantages—but so many organizations still aren’t leveraging the straightforward, undifferentiated strengths that they possess. They expend most of their energy shoring up “weaknesses,” which despite their efforts will at best become “less weak,” but never become a strength. Whereas applying that same energy in leveraging their strengths will have a large positive effect. It’s even just more fun to play to your strengths instead of wallowing in weaknesses.\\nIt is of course better when the strength is differentiated from the competition. This is especially obvious in a mature market where everyone is saying the same things on their home page, pricing the same way, and different only in tertiary characteristics. Winning in your own way can defeat “better” competitors.\\nIt’s even better when that differentiation is durable over time. It has never been more difficult to establish a permanent advantage, when all software can be reproduced, all business models can be replicated, and the entire world is both your market and your competitors, which makes it all the more important to decide what one or two moats you will build. The strategy is the place to name those moats.\\nThis companion article on “leverage” provides expanded examples and ideas for all of the above.\\nTailoring the decisions for the strengths of this organization, avoiding (rather than reversing) weaknesses, even better when the strength is differentiated, identifying and investing in durable differentiation, so that moats are constructed in the long run, is required for a strategy to be “how we will win.”\\nExample: Zappos started in 1999—early Internet, no social media, few people with broadband, few people comfortable buying anything online, much less buying shoes, which for 100 years was bought only after first trying them on in person. Zappos started with a differentiated insight (the companion article explains how “insights” can be leverage): That people would actually buy shoes online, under the right circumstances. They built a moat out of a combination of surprising decisions (also explained in the companion article): (a) postage-paid returns even 364 days after purchase, (b) legendary support who did things like buying pizzas for customers, (c) a corporate culture of employee empowerment; it takes that combination of strong, expensive decisions to create the conditions by which people would dare to buy online, thus unlocking an entirely new retail channel. Only by having all three of those components did the moat work; if you don’t empower employees, they can’t order pizza on the spur of the moment; if your return policy isn’t ridiculously generous, people will be too scared to order shoes sight-unseen. Because their vision and decisions were so incredible (literally “not credible”), competitors laughed at them while they enjoyed a constant stream of positive press. The result was the most successful online shoe store for a decade, reaching annual revenues of $1B before its tenth birthday.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\nAsymmetric \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA sailboat always moves forward.\\nThis remarkable fact is due to its asymmetrical shape: it is pointy at the front and flat in the back. This creates resistance to moving backwards, but a natural ease in moving forward. Even when the water is randomly undulating, “backward” forces are muted, while “forward” forces are allowed, so the boat glides forward. Asymmetries can amplify positive effects while muting negative ones, resulting in a net-positive force even under conditions of random inputs.\\nGreat strategies prescribe activities that always move the company forward, despite the inevitable bad luck and setbacks. To do that, the activities must exhibit asymmetry, where the upside vastly exceeds the cost, so that even if you took 2x longer to achieve 50% of what you expected, you still win.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn’t be riskier.\\n—Howard Marks\\n\\n\\nThis is the mechanism behind Venture Capital portfolios, which are investments in a slate of early-stage startups. The worst-case outcome for each bet is that they lose 100% of their investment, but in the best case they can gain 10,000%. A few large successes more than make up for the many failures, so the portfolio in total comes out positive. Investors call these “asymmetric bets.” Economists call this “convexity.”\\nStrategy must create a portfolio of bets having this “VC-like” asymmetric quality, whether for a small startup trying to find product/market fit or a mature company entering new markets. A sign of a bad strategy is when success requires everything to go right. With a set of asymmetric bets, the successes render the failures moot, and so the unpredictable waves crashing into the boat still result in forward motion.\\nThis companion article details strategies that work well in an unpredictable world. One of the few strengths of a new startup is that it can learn faster, react faster, deliver faster; startups are favored when the waters are uncertain.\\nOne form of asymmetric bet is entering a large and growing market. Besides the obvious benefits3 there is the asymmetry of optionality: There are many niches to exploit, many possible ways for a product to deliver value, many marketing and sales channels, and there’s more of all of it every year. Because there are many options to try, there are many ways to succeed; if your first few ideas don’t work, the next one might. Waves on the boat.\\n\\n3\\n Potential customers are already spending money, which means budgets are pre-allocated and pricing structures are well-understood, the press is already talking about it, marketing channels already exist, and the “pie” is growing, so even a small slice of the pie automatically grows.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\\n—Albert Einstein\\n\\n\\nAnother kind of asymmetry is a process that compounds, meaning that the more of it there is, the faster it grows. Things with this characteristic naturally grow larger than anything that grows in a more linear fashion, even if they start out small. Examples are customer retention, customer upgrades, and employee retention. Another example are growth-vectors that are proportional to the size of the current customer base, such as word of mouth referrals and viral products (e.g. once you join a social platform or collaborative online tool, you tend to get other people you know to join as well). Most things that grow non-linearly don’t grow exponentially—that’s normal, and still a great strategy. A common example is a reseller channel, because each reseller could bring you a number of clients over time, so when the number of resellers grows by N, the number of potential customers they bring grows by N\\xa0×\\xa0M. For example, Inuit grew Quickbooks by providing software to CPAs that made their life easy, but only if their clients used Quickbooks. The CPAs started requiring their clients to buy Quickbooks, and so a smaller number of CPAs created a much larger number of Quickbooks sales.\\nIn the negative, companies also face asymmetric threats. With ten competitors, only a few need to become break-out winners to pose a significant challenge. Like the famous statement by the IRA after a bombing failed to kill British prime minister Margaret Thatcher: “Today we were unlucky, but remember we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always.” A strategy that places a number of asymmetric bets doesn’t need to be lucky always.\\nEvery plan will face challenges, both foreseeable and bad luck. If everything has to go right for the plan to succeed, it won’t succeed. Whether a single investment has asymmetric upside, or a portfolio of bets collectively has large upside, exploiting asymmetries maximizes the chance that the strategy will succeed despite the inevitable travails and uncontrollable luck, and thus is vital to “how we will win.”\\nExample: Amazon is the cliché example, but only because it’s apropos, even ignoring AWS. Originally a book-seller only, they have never stopped taking bets, whether on adjacent markets (e.g. selling electronics), reselling internal systems (e.g. Amazon warehouses, logistics, robotics, fulfillment, were all broken apart and sold as separate products), or entirely new kinds of product (smart phones, cloud computing). More impressive is when the new bets purposefully disrupted previous businesses; according to early employee Andy Johns (article, podcast), Bezos was so adamant that the Kindle be successful, despite the fact that it would hurt their physical book business, that he assigned the Kindle project to the executive who was currently over the book business, saying “Effective tomorrow, your job is to kill your old business with a Kindle.” The key thing is: many of these bets failed, and failure was expected. Failure isn’t desirable, but each bet had out-sized potential upside and budget-able downside. Even Kindle was unprofitable for years and the Amazon Fire Phone was an abject failure. Bezos explains in his own words that their strategy is exactly the theory of a portfolio of asymmetric bets with expected failures:\\n\\n“If you’re going to take bold bets, they’re going to be experiments. And if they’re experiments you don’t know ahead of time if they’re going to work. Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn’t work.”\\n“I’ve made billions of dollars of failures at Amazon.com. Literally. You have to be super clear about what kind of company you’re trying to build. … We said we were going to take big bets. We said we were going to fail.”\\n—The Guardian, 2014\\n\\n\\nFuturistic \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe best time to plant a tree is one hundred years ago. The second-best time to plant a tree is today.\\n—A proverb claimed by many peoples, across thousands of years\\n\\n\\n“Being agile4” is a great way to climb the proverbial mountain-shrouded-in-fog. Some paths are the right ones, but backtracking is inevitable; it’s a sign of puzzling-out, not a sign of failure. The job of strategy is to identify which mountain we’re trying to climb in the first place—the puzzle we’re solving for, the opportunity we’re exploiting. If an “agile, self-managed” team climbs the wrong mountain, it was all a waste.\\n\\n4\\n Meaning: Don’t pretend you can predict the future, assume the quantity of “things we don’t know” is larger than the quantity “things we do know,” iterate quickly on hypotheses that you proactively attempt to disprove, and adjust in the presence of new information. The team that learns the fastest, wins. The team that spends three months trying predict the future, is now three months behind, and the future still won’t unfold as they predicted.\\nStrategy looks further into the future than anything else at the company. Therefore, it has the responsibility to take the long view. Which is especially difficult, as the future is unpredictable, and data tells you about the past, but rarely about the future.\\nIf you can solve a problem in a month, you probably should, but that also means it’s not a strategic problem. Anything that can be built in three months, isn’t the way you will have constructed a moat that will take competitors years to overcome. Anything that specifies features or timelines is a roadmap, not a strategy; a strategy specifies market and business outcomes and the primary decisions and secondary consequences. Anything that specifies teams or roles or hiring or processes is an operational plan, not a strategy; a strategy details the outcomes and activities that require the entire company to accomplish together, not what one team needs to accomplish alone.\\nPeople naturally get distracted by the immediate, the urgent, the tactical, the “low-hanging fruit.” Strategy is the place where we select the high-hanging fruit, the “important, but not urgent” quadrant of the Eisenhower Matrix. Then executed as the Rocks in your “Rocks, Pebbles, Sand” prioritization framework.\\nPart of explaining “how to win” is defining what the “winning” state looks like. Often called the “vision statement,” it describes an what the world will look like when we’re successful:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOxfam\\nA just world without poverty\\n\\n\\nHabitat for Humanity\\nA world where everyone has a decent place to live\\n\\n\\nStripe\\nIncrease the GDP of the Internet\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft  (years ago)\\nA computer on every desk and in every home\\n\\n\\nTesla  (original)\\nCreate the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the world’s transition to electric vehicles\\n\\n\\nWP Engine\\nPower the freedom to create online\\n\\n\\nYouTube\\nGive everyone a voice and show them the world\\n\\n\\nGoDaddy\\nRadically shift the global economy toward independent entrepreneurial ventures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Vision statement is often the first sentence the strategy document, but was the last thing crafted by the authors of that document. Only once you fully understand the challenges you face, the main, coherent courses of actions to undertake, and the results you want, can you summarize a clear vision of what the future will be.\\nStrategy is where we specify the most critical long-term challenges facing the company, and the rocks that are the most important things, not to win the battles today, but to determine how we will have won the war three years from now, how we will achieve our vision, how we will win.\\nExample: After Google purchased YouTube, they set a far-future goal of attaining a billion daily views. This filtered down to everything from demands on technical architecture, to strategic debates such as whether that enormous quantity of views could be achieved by user-generated content alone or whether they needed to license libraries of existing TV shows and movies. At one point they realized that the global Internet network infrastructure did not have enough capacity to stream a billion views per day, so Google invested billions of dollars in fiber and data centers to prevent that from becoming a bottleneck—billion of dollars they would not have spent without a vision of the future that mandated that investment.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\nBad Strategy \\nTell-tale signs of a strategy that lacks these qualities:\\n\\nNot simple\\nPages of detail5.

After explaining why, the following system solves both failures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Delivering maximum value in minimum time” sounds wise, but it’s not exactly a stunning insight. It’s not like we’re trying to take an eternity to deliver trivialities.\\nIt is more analytical—but no more insightful—to insist on “Maximizing ROI.” Return-On-Investment is some measure of “value,” divided by some measure of “time,” yielding some measure of “productivity.”\\nWith good intentions and this reasonable-sounding goal, we reach for the rubric: A spreadsheet of inputs of numeric “value” and “time,” a calculation of the metric of productivity, and an output where the best ideas are sorted to the top.\\nInvisible failures of the rubric \\nUnfortunately, the rubric fails us for several reasons. The failures are not obvious, so we don’t realize they’re happening. Explaining the traps will lead to a framework that avoids the traps.\\n“ROI” contains more noise than signal \\nConsider a feature that ended up producing 20% less impact and taking 50% more time than originally expected—a common outcome in the real world:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImpact\\nEffort\\nROI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEstimated\\n60\\n4\\n15\\n\\n\\nActual\\n48\\n6\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this reasonable scenario, it ended up producing half the ROI than originally calculated. Therefore, in retrospect, the initial ROI estimate was largely noise. Apply this observation to a typical ROI rubric:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImpact\\nEffort\\nROI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature A\\n34\\n2\\n17\\n\\n\\nFeature B\\n60\\n4\\n15\\n\\n\\nFeature C\\n36\\n3\\n12\\n\\n\\nFeature D\\n10\\n1\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe spreadsheet suggests (A) is the winner, and in particular that (A) is clearly better than (D). But neither of those statements are true. If (A) could easily result in half its stated ROI, there’s no objective justification to claim its superiority over (D), or over any other item.\\nShocked at this revelation, we could react by ignoring the lesson. We could justify (A)’s supremacy by telling ourselves “estimation errors cancel themselves out.” But the errors do not cancel out. Effort is almost always under-estimated; 4-sprint projects that stretch into 6 sprints are not “cancelled out” by an equal number of 4-sprint projects that are completely finished in 2 sprints.\\n“Impact” is ill-defined \\nNo matter how you measure impact, your numbers end up far less precise than they appear in the spreadsheet.\\nIt’s difficult to predict numbers like “revenue-increase due to feature X.” Teams use various techniques to address the uncertainty, but in every case the number in the spreadsheet contains significant error:\\n\\nRevenue we would get from existing customers currently asking for this feature.  That’s precise but often uncorrelated with how much money we will make from it in the long run, so it’s not an accurate measure of impact. \\nAdditional sales we would make in the next year if we had this feature.  This number is low-confidence, high-error. Even in hindsight it’s hard to attribute revenue from a single customer to a single feature; if it’s unmeasurable post hoc, surely it’s unpredictable ex ante. \\nUse a relative scale, e.g. “1-5,” calibrated by previously-created features.  Defined as “1 is like feature X, 5 is like feature Y.” Not only is this a wild guess, different people will interpret the scale differently, yet answers differing by a single point generates a large variance in computed ROI.\\n\\nIt’s even worse when want to combine multiple metrics of impact, e.g. revenue, unit-profitability, and retention. Each contains intrinsic error, then a mathematical combination compounds the error, then the ROI calculation expands the error yet again.\\nYou can’t tell from glancing at the spreadsheet, because input numbers appear typical and output numbers boast many digits after the decimal place. But those digits aren’t indicative of precision. They’re a random number generator.\\nThe Fermi Solution \\nThese traps dictate requirements for a solution. We need scores containing dramatically more signal than noise. The scores must be well-defined, which means their definition and estimation should be obvious and uncontroversial.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nOnly Fermi estimations allowed \\nThe first full-scale nuclear bomb was detonated at 5:29am, July 16, 1945, in the New Mexican desert of the United States. The physicists who invented it were huddled in a truck behind a plate of welder’s glass to reduce the radiation to non-lethal levels.\\nThe physicists were already causing trouble. Future Nobel Prize-winner Richard Feynman inexplicably decided to observe the blast without eye protection, causing frightening but ultimately temporary blindness. Current Nobel Prize-winner Enrico Fermi had taken bets with military guards about how much of the atmosphere would ignite, and whether it would incinerate the entire state or the entire world; some of the guards asked to be excused from the base, angering the project director.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Enrico Fermi” by Argonne National Laboratory is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.\\n\\n\\nFermi was also interested in the amount of energy released by the blast—one of the main goals of the test. Not wanting to wait for official analysis, he made his own estimate on the spot, using a technique that now bears his name, and that we will use to fix our rubric:\\n\\nAbout 40 seconds after the explosion the air blast reached me. I tried to estimate its strength by dropping from about six feet small pieces of paper before, during, and after the passage of the blast wave. Since, at the time, there was no wind I could observe very distinctly and actually measure the displacement of the pieces of paper that were in the process of falling while the blast was passing. The shift was about 2 1/2 meters, which, at the time, I estimated to correspond to the blast that would be produced by 10,000 tons of TNT.\\n—Enrico Fermi, Top Secret interview July 16, 1945, declassified in 1965\\n\\nThe official estimate of the energy output of the blast was 21,000 tons of TNT. Fermi’s estimate was surprisingly accurate given such inaccurate input data and quick, simple, mental calculations. How did he do it?\\nThe trick—useful everywhere in life—is to estimate values using only orders-of-magnitude, a.k.a. powers-of-ten. No “low/high ranges,” no precision, not even any digits other than a 1 followed by a quantity of 0s. It sounds far too imprecise to be practical, and yet Fermi’s bits of paper demonstrate that it just might work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoel Spolsky famously loved an interview question built for Fermi estimation: How many gas stations are there in Los Angeles County? “I don’t know,” although accurate, fails the interview. Fermi estimation, succeeds.\\n\\nThere are 10 million people in the LA area (or at least, more than 1 million and less than 100 million, so by the rule of “only powers-of-ten,” our number is 10 million. The actual number in LA County happens to be 10 million).\\n1 car per person (or at least, not 10 and not 0.1. The actual number is 0.54).\\nA person refills 1 time per month (the actual number is closer to 2.5/month, but it’s not 10 and not 0.1).\\nA gas station handles 10,000 refills per month (200 per day yields 6000 per month; it’s not 1000 nor 100,000).\\nWith 10 million refills per month (10 million cars with 1 refill per month), divided by 10,000 refills per station, 1000 gas stations are required.\\n\\nDespite being wildly inaccurate in detail, the end result of 1000 gas stations is indeed the nearest order-of-magnitude to the actual number of 600. Surprisingly accurate, considering we arrived at an answer in a minute or two, without looking up a single number.\\nWhat would happen if we used only Fermi estimates in our ROI calculator?\\nAn immediate result is that most numbers are trivial to estimate. Note how easy it was to decide the values in the gas station example, because the two adjacent power-of-ten choices were definitely wrong. It’s nice to be so confident! Relish that.\\nAnother result is that we’ve satisfied one requirement generated from the failures of the rubric: Scores are either identical or very different, causing calculation error to be small in comparison. The values are largely obvious and uncontroversial, if only because our artificial constraint on their values makes the adjacent choices absurd. This is progress.\\nSometimes the numbers are still controversial, e.g. Could this product produce $1M in the next few years, or actually $10M because it would dramatically increase both retention and our ability to win new deals? But this debate is a wonderful use of our time, because it means people have wildly different assumptions, or different levels of optimism, or a different understanding of the customer, the market, or the idea. So another constructive result of Fermi estimation is that we spend our debate-time on strategic-level discussions, and no time on areas where we disagree in small degrees that are in any case overwhelmed by typical estimation-error.\\nIn exchange for this progress, we lose precision. And admittedly, sometimes we do possess precise input data. For example, maybe we could look up the fact that the average number of cars per person is 0.54, and use that figure instead of 1. Surely it’s wise to retain precision whenever possible? Yes, but only if you recognize that, after doing math with other Fermi estimates, the end result is still not more accurate than the power-of-ten. That is, even using 0.54 instead of 1, as soon as you combine it with your extremely inaccurate estimate of 10,000 refills-per-station, you still have to zero-out all the digits in the result except the first one. You must meticulously discard the noise; if you’re diligent about that, your estimation is more accurate. Otherwise, maybe you should just enjoy the simplicity of the basic Fermi system.\\nSo we’ve satisfied the first requirement. What about the final remaining requirement, which is to clarify the definition of “impact?”\\nFermi Impact: Quantitive edition \\nFermi estimation solves the puzzle of how to estimate the revenue impact of a sizable feature. We can pick any definition we want, but limit ourselves to Fermi estimation, and suddenly it becomes easy, or at least a simpler discussion. Any of these definitions could work:\\n\\nThis feature will increase revenue by: $1k/mo, $10k/mo, $100k/mo\\nThis feature will increase new customers/month by: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000\\nThe take-rate of this feature in our existing customer base would be: 1%, 10%, 50%\\nThe number of customers who would actively use this feature would be: 0.1%, 1%, 10%, 50%\\n\\nWe cheated a little in those last two, because “100%” is not a possibility. Still, a 5x separation is pretty good; the danger is when the difference is only 2x or 20%. This is still a much wider spread then, say, Fibonacci estimation.\\nIt’s clear how this works with quantitative measures, but what about important things that are not numbers?\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nFermi Impact: Qualitative edition \\nHow you score things which aren’t numbers like “brand development,” “competitive advantage,” or “customer delight?”\\nThe following is a real example from a few years ago, when WP Engine was launching a new product line called Atlas1. We decided to build a thought-leadership presentation that would engage software developers on topics relevant to the new product line. We wanted it to be genuinely intriguing and useful. We brainstormed twenty-two topic ideas, all pretty good at first glance. How should we select just four or five topics, given that “intriguing” and “useful” are qualitative and subjective?\\n\\n1\\n Tagline: The complete Headless WordPress Platform for absurdly fast dynamic sites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, we decided on our goal, even if impossible to measure, or not even a number. The primary goal was for everyone to come away loving the content and interested in our software. We broke this down into four sub-goals, where the overall goal would be achieved only to the extent that all four of the sub-goals were achieved:\\n\\nTopic is widely applicable\\nTopic matters to real people\\nTopic is insightful (i.e. non-obvious to a typical practitioner)\\nTopic is relevant to specific features or capabilities in Atlas (i.e. self-promotion)\\n\\nThe next step was to convert these concepts into something we could “score,” i.e. specific questions that a person could contemplate and debate with another person. Otherwise, two people will have different ideas of what each goal means. The answers still won’t be numbers, but at least the questions are specific:\\n\\nHow many customers care about this topic?\\nHow much do those customers care?\\nHow insightful is our perspective on this topic?\\nHow powerfully or uniquely does Atlas pay off the insight?\\n\\nBecause the answers aren’t things you can measure with numbers and units, we had to use some sort of “1-5” scoring system or, to take the Fermi lesson, powers-of-ten numbers. The key is to be specific as to what each number means, otherwise two people will have different interpretations for a phrase like “Insight is a 2 out of 5.”\\n1. How many customers care about this topic? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFermi Value\\nDefinition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n100\\nDefinitionally everyone\\n\\n\\n70\\nMost\\n\\n\\n30\\nSome\\n\\n\\n0\\nI can think of one or two\\n\\n\\n0\\nNo one\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.

Because “all four” scores were required to deliver on the original goal, multiplying the scores2 sorts the best to the top.\\n\\n2\\n The mathematically-inclined reader might point out that because all values are powers-of-ten, the operation “multiply everything and sort” yields exactly the same result as “Number these 1-5, then add everything and sort,” because the latter is just the logarithm of the former. Why, then, bother with Fermi values? (a) As in the first question, specific values (as opposed to strictly only powers-of-ten) might have a valid meaning, which creates different values from “1-5.” This “breaks ties” in a meaningful way. (b) By emphasizing that the values are designed to be widely divergent, we generate better specific phrases, and more agreement in scoring each topic, and therefore hopefully a more accurate output.\\nIt worked; the presentation was routinely scored “5 out of 5” in post-event surveys3, and the biggest complaint was a desire for even more detail. That is a “complaint” indicative of success: It means “I want to hear more from you,” and therefore is further evidence that the choice of topics was spot-on.\\n\\n3\\n Oh the irony of scoring the presentation 1-5 after everything we just said!\\nFermi time estimates \\nWe’ve explored how to estimate “impact” with Fermi-approved values, but what about time-estimates? Those also exhibit large errors. They, too, need the Fermi treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly twenty years ago, before Scrum defeated rivals like Extreme Programming to become the de facto standard for waterfall-averse software developers, our engineering team at Smart Bear Software used a simplistic but effective method of estimating work. Our software was installed on-premises by customers (this was The Time Before SaaS), so “continuous deployment” was impossible. Instead, we made a few major releases per year, supplemented with minor bug-fix releases. We planned about four months of work at a time.\\nWe scrawled each idea on an index card, with only enough space for a title and a few bullets about scope and intent. We placed time estimates in the bottom-right corner, but the only three choices were: 2d, 2w, 2m—two days, two weeks, or two months4. Whatever you think the real estimate is, round up.\\n\\n4\\n I hear you yelling “No! Story Points!” Hang in there, it’s OK, this was long ago in the Third Age when the Elves still abided in Middle-Earth. Elves don’t use story-points.\\nThe overwhelming majority of cards generated no disagreement over the estimate; this saved us hours of analysis and debate. The controversial ones were always a matter of definition and scope, which is a typical and important conversation to have, regardless of your system for estimating work.\\nTo select the items and plan team capacity, we spread the cards across a table, and each person held the set of cards they were going to execute. The project timeframe was measured in weeks; a typical window was 16 weeks. We used a rough conversion that two 2d cards equals one week, and one 2m card equals eight weeks5. It was easy to see who was over- or under-scheduled, and then load-balance according to capacity and ability.\\n\\n5\\n You might wonder why we didn’t just use a mathematically identical scale like 0.5w,\\xa02w,\\xa08w or some abstract unit of “effort” that could scale like 1, 4, 16, or a Fibonacci number of weeks. The reason for using real time is that we felt it was easier to imagine than abstract units. The reason for keeping the quantity of values to three is the Fermi reason: This minimizes controversy and forces you to think critically about scope.\\nIf a project required multiple cards (nowadays we’d call that an “epic” or “big rock”), we marked that set of cards with a color. The idea is that either all the cards of that color should be accepted, or none, otherwise we would have spent a lot of time on something without having shipped a usable feature.\\nHere’s the punchline: It typically took a few hours to create the entire plan, and four months later we typically hit the plan within a week of the original estimate.\\nIn retrospect, it’s a form of Fermi Estimation. It’s not exactly powers-of-ten, but measured in work-days it’s close: 2 vs 10 vs 45. Essentially powers-of-five, it still maintained the key idea of Fermi—to have so few choices that the correct one is easy to identify—while also being chunks of time that a human can relate to.\\nPutting it together \\nLet’s combine these ideas, do the math, and decide whether it’s helping us make better decisions.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nSingle-valued impact \\nSuppose we’re picking features to implement, and the only metric of value is the revenue we believe that feature will generate in the next twelve months. We’ll convert “effort” into work-days as given just above, and round ROI to the nearest 10% to make it easy to read. Here’s a typical result:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNTM Revenue\\nEffort\\nROI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature A\\n$100,000\\n2m\\n2200\\n\\n\\nFeature B\\n$10,000\\n2w\\n1000\\n\\n\\nFeature C\\n$1,000\\n2d\\n500\\n\\n\\nFeature D\\n$10,000\\n2m\\n200\\n\\n\\nFeature E\\n$1,000\\n2w\\n100\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has some nice properties:\\n\\nBiased towards more impact\\nProducts A, B, and C are each examples of “takes more time, but generates more impact.” The rubric prefers more impact in every case. This is a good bias, especially since impact in reality is often less than we had hoped.\\nStill correctly ordered if we mis-judged\\nConsider what happens if we misjudge impact by 20% and effort by 50%—the original hypothetical from the beginning of this article. If Feature A delivered only $80,000 and took three months, the actual ROI would be about 1200, still ahead of Feature B. Or if Feature B delivered $8,000 in three weeks, actual ROI is 533, still ahead of Feature C. Therefore, typical misjudgments are not changing our decision. We fixed that deficiency.\\nEasy to explain to others\\nIt’s important to be able to explain your decisions crisply. The typical ROI rubric does not; the explanation is that one item slightly edged out another item, which isn’t confidence-inspiring, and doesn’t sound like a strategic decision. In contrast, Fermi ROI is easy to summarize; for example, why Feature A was selected: Feature A has by far the greatest potential for impact. The impact is so large, it’s worth spending multiple months on it. Or why Feature B wasn’t selected: Feature B would be faster to implement, and therefore is a great idea, but Feature A’s impact is so much larger, it’s still the better choice. If we get part-way into Feature A and realize it’s much harder than we thought, or much lower impact than we thought, then we’ll pivot into Feature B.\\n\\nMulti-valued impact \\nIn the “presentation” example, we had four impact scores, which we multiplied together. The reason it made sense to combine them in that way, is that all four are required to achieve the goal (as explained previously). When you have a case where multiple factors are needed together to achieve a singular goal, then multiplying is the correct way to compute the score for that goal.\\nA common mistake is to use this formula when there are scores for things which are not related. For example, suppose you’re wanting to maximize revenue, and also customer delight. You could make a Fermi score for each, but how do you combine them to get an ROI?\\nThere are two answers, depending on your philosophy:\\n\\nDo not combine unlike attributes\\nThere is no way to compare “revenue” with “delight.” These are different units of measurement, so any combination is nonsensical. Instead, decide which of the factors is most important, and compute the ROI of just that. Then, if there is a tie, you can break the tie by comparing “delight.” This is also easy to explain after the fact: Features A, B, C are are equally effective at generating revenue, which is our most important goal. Among those, Feature B increases customer delight the most as well, so we’re implementing B.\\nAdd instead of multiply (only when attributes are equally important)\\nAlthough it is arguably a lack of strategic decision-making to claim that multiple attributes are all equally important, it can make sense if you are scheduling secondary features. That is, suppose you’ve already scheduled the most important strategic items, and now you’re “filling in” with “quick wins” where you truly don’t care in what manner each is a “win.” Here you add the values instead of multiply. This way, a huge ROI in one area wins (but we don’t care which area). Getting some value in two areas, is not as good as getting a lot of value in one area. This final point is satisfied when you use Fermi values, but traditional rubrics get it wrong.\\n\\nBreaking ties \\nThe Fermi-style rubric has another interesting property: There are only a few unique values of ROI. In the “revenue” example above, there are only 3 realistic numbers for revenue, and only 3 values of effort, so only 9 unique combinations of ROI.\\nThe good news is, the computation clearly separates the best from the rest. The bad news is, you can easily make ties. In the “presentation” example earlier, in real life we had two topics in clear first and second place, but a three-way tie for third. We didn’t have time for all five topics, so we had to break the tie.\\nThese ties are not a failing of the system. Just the opposite: It means we are able to identify ties, rather than allowing noise to trick us into believing one is the “winner.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, we have to break the tie. There are several ways to do it, while preserving the advantages of this method.\\nAdding precision or intentional bias \\nIt’s tempting to add “precision” to your input values, and indeed that might break the tie. But beware of falling back into the accuracy problem and the explanatory deficiency of typical rubrics.\\nYou should add precision only if:\\n\\nYou are certain the precision is accurate, or\\nYou are creating an intentional bias, e.g. to over-weight one factor relative to another.\\n\\nThere’s a mathematical trap in option (2). It’s tempting to “weight” a factor by multiplying it by a constant, e.g. “we’ll double this score, so it counts twice as much as other scores.” However, this actually doesn’t do anything at all, because it just means all totals for all items are multiplied by 2; this doesn’t change the ordering, and doesn’t break ties.\\nInstead, what matters are the sizes of the intervals between the choices. That is, if scoring for this item was originally 1, 10, 100, you could reduce how sensitive the total is to this value by diminishing the differences between values, e.g. by going up by powers of three instead of powers of ten: 1, 3, 9.\\nYou also don’t need to keep the spacing regular. You might rank more options as a 0 to effectively “filter out” things that don’t meet a desired standard. You might decide that the two options at the top of the scale, that originally were 100 and 1000, should be more like 800 and 1000, reflecting a bias that “both options have essentially the same value, one just slightly more.”\\nThe run-off \\nGiven a set of items that we’ve agreed are “equal in ROI,” pick a new dimension to break the tie.\\nTime-estimates are no longer part of the process. We already agreed these are efficient in terms of impact-versus-time, so now we focus only on some additional dimension of value. This simplifies the process, which is not only nice for decision-making, but also for explaining the decision.\\nIf you don’t want to evaluate the items along a new dimension, you could eliminate some of the existing dimensions. For example, in the “presentation” case, we decided that, all else being equal, we would rather select topics where we have a really interesting insight, rather than topics that are great at selling the product. Therefore, we performed a run-off using “insight × reach,” ignoring the other values.\\nTo determine which is the most important dimension to maximize, using this guiding question:\\n\\nIf we maximize this dimension in the next few months, then even if we get nothing else accomplished, it will still be a success. Conversely, if we moved other needles, but this dimension remained unchanged, it will have been a failure.\\n\\nThe human factor \\nA different way to break the tie is to include something else that you value, but that shouldn’t be used to make the primary decision.\\nSince the primary decision is a tie, we’re “allowed” to indulge ourselves in something else, even something unconnected to “business metrics” in the usual sense. Because we’ve already maximized a business metric, you could break ties using something completely different:\\nTeam Excitement \\nWhether because it’s fun, interesting, or the team is just tired of hearing certain customer feedback and really wants to do something about it, “excitement” is an excellent, under-appreciated attribute. Excited teams are happier, feel more fulfilled, feel more listened-to, and work harder and better. It is the elusive “win-win.”\\nSince “excitement” is an ambiguous term, one way to convert to a Fermi value is the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFermi  Excitement\\nDefinition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\nNo one is excited to work on it.\\n\\n\\n1\\nOne person is excited to work on it.\\n\\n\\n10\\nAbout half the team is excited to work on it.\\n\\n\\n100\\nAll, or all but one, is excited to work on it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConfidence \\nConfidence is hard to measure, but you know it when you feel it (or don’t feel it). It might not be correlated with risk—just because you are confident, doesn’t mean you are correct. Still, faced with two choices, where you’re sure you know how to execute the first, but with the second you’re full of doubt, it’s logical to pick the first.\\nSince “confidence” is an ambiguous term, some people use some sort of risk percentage, e.g. “I’m 60% sure we can do this.” But pinning down a number is suspicious, and debates don’t seem fruitful. One way to convert to a Fermi value is the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFermi  Confidence\\nDefinition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\nThere’s no way we can pull this off.\\n\\n\\n1\\nI mean we can try, but don’t be surprised when it fails.\\n\\n\\n10\\nWe can probably do this; we’ll be surprised if it goes very wrong.\\n\\n\\n100\\nThis is completely within our domain of expertise, we’ve successfully executed something similar in the past, and nothing in the task-breakdown is uncertain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/roi-rubric/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFermi ROI: Fixing the ROI rubric\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Invisible failures of the rubric“ROI” contains more noise than signal“Impact” is ill-definedThe Fermi SolutionOnly Fermi estimations allowedFermi Impact: Quantitive editionFermi Impact: Qualitative editionFermi time estimatesPutting it togetherSingle-valued impactMulti-valued impactBreaking tiesAdding precision or intentional biasThe run-offThe human factor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Make a SLC instead.\\n\\nby Jason Cohen on August 22, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n“MVP” is a selfish process, abusing customers so you can “learn.” SLC is an alternate philosophy that results in fast, validated learning, that customers love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProduct teams have been repeating the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mantra for a decade now, without re-evaluating whether it’s the right way to maximize learning while pleasing the customer.\\nWell, it’s not the best system. It’s selfish and it hurts customers. We don’t build MVPs at WP Engine.\\nThe motivation behind the MVP is still valid:\\n\\nBuild something small, because small things are quick and inexpensive to test.\\nGet it into the market quickly, because real learning occurs only when real customers are using a real product.\\nTrash it or hard-pivot if it’s a failure, or invest if it’s a seedling with potential.\\n\\nMVPs are great for startups and product teams because they maximize so-called “validated learning” as quickly as possible. And while customer interviews are useful, you learn brand new things when a customer actually uses the product. But MVPs are a selfish act.\\nThe problem is: Customers hate MVPs. Startups are encouraged by the great Reid Hoffman to “launch early enough that you’re embarrassed by your v1.0 release.” But no customer wants to use an unfinished product that the creators are embarrassed by. Customers want great products they can use now.\\nMVPs are too M and rarely V. Customers see that, and hate it. It might be great for the product team, but it’s bad for customers. And ultimately, what’s bad for customers is bad for the company.\\nFortunately, there’s a better way to build and validate products. The insight comes by honoring the utility of MVPs (listed above) while giving just as much consideration to the customer’s experience.\\nIn order for the product to be small and delivered quickly, it has to be simple. Customers accept simple products every day. Even if it doesn’t do everything needed, as long as the product never claimed to do more than it does, customers are forgiving. For example, it was okay that early versions Google Docs had only 3% of the features of Microsoft Word, because Docs did a great job at what it was primarily designed for, which is simplicity and real-time collaboration.\\nGoogle Docs was simple, but also complete. This is decidedly different from the classic MVP, which by definition isn’t complete (in fact, it’s “embarrassing”). “Simple” is good, “incomplete” is not. The customer should have a genuine desire to use the product, as-is. Not because it’s version 0.1 of something complex, but because it’s version 1.0 of something simple.\\nIt is not contradictory for products to be simple as well as complete. Examples include the first versions of WhatsApp, Snapchat, Stripe, Twilio, Twitter, and Slack. Some of those later expanded to add complexity (Snapchat, Stripe, Slack), whereas some kept it simple as a permanent value (Twitter, WhatsApp). Virgin Air and Southwest Airlines both started with only a single route—small, but complete.\\nThe final ingredient is that the product has to be lovable. People have to want to use it. Products that do less but are loved, are more successful than products which have more features, but that people dislike. The original, very-low-feature, very-highly-loved, hyper-successful early versions of all the products listed in the previous paragraph are examples. The Darwinian success loop of a product is a function of love, not of features.\\nThere are many ways to generate love. “Minimum” and “viable” are definitely not among those ways. The current-in-vogue way is through design: Elegant UX combined with delightful UI. But there are other ways. The attitude and culture of the company itself can generate love, such as Buffer’s blog with its surprising transparency or MeetEdgar’s blog genuinely helping entrepreneurs or HubSpot’s blog which early on was at least as instrumental to their customers’ success as the actual product. Another way is through a deep connection to the psyche and work-style of customers, like Heroku who broke with marketing tradition by filling the homepage with command-line examples instead of benefit-statements, thereby connecting instantly with their geeky target customer:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee this article for many more examples of how to generate love.\\nFrom this reasoning, years ago I named what I believe is the correct alternative to the MVP: Simple, Lovable and Complete (SLC). We pronounce it “Slick.” As in: “What’s the ‘Slick’ version of your idea?”\\nAnother benefit of SLC becomes apparent when you consider the next version of the product.\\nA SLC product does not require ongoing development in order to add value. It’s possible that v1 should evolve for years into a v4, but you also have the option of not investing further in the product, yet it still adds value. An MVP that never gets additional investment is just a bad product. A SLC that never gets additional investment is a good, if modest product.\\nAlthough not called SLC, there’s a popular meme in product circles that neatly encapsulates the idea of SLC in a diagram: The Modes of Transportation example1 from the Spotify product team:\\n\\n1\\n Critics correctly point out that Tesla did not follow this system—they didn’t make a skateboard and then a bike and finally a car, they just made a car. This is a valid critique, when you know that the only product goal is “car.” Indeed, there isn’t a SLC version of a car—it’s a leap of faith. Still, human society did evolve someone like this, with basic wheeled objects, later a bike, and still later a car. Also this model is especially useful when your startup set out to make a simple product, not even knowing that a car could exist. Software companies often do evolve this way; the main text gives a real-world example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA skateboard is a SLC product. It’s faster than walking, it’s simple, many people love it, and it’s a complete product that doesn’t need additions to be fun or practical. At the same time, you can evolve the skateboard by adding a stem and handlebars, to create a scooter—only slightly less simple, and definitely loveable and complete. Next, you could grow the wheels, add a seat and some gears, and you have a bike. Again, less simple but now you have a product with massive benefits of speed, distance, and energy-efficiency.\\nZooming into one of our examples above, Snapchat took an SLC progression similar to the transportation metaphor. The first iteration of the product was a screen where tapping anywhere took a picture that you could then send to someone else, at which time it disappeared. No video, no filters, no social networking, no commenting and no storage—simple, yet Lovable and Complete, as evidenced by its massive adoption. The insight of “no storage” was critical, but many people have theorized that the simplicity of the interface was also critical. The very fact that it was simple, while not sacrificing love-ability or completeness, caused its success.\\nLater they added lots of stuff—video, filters, timelines, even video cameras inside sunglasses. It’s OK for products to become complex. Starting out SLC does not preclude becoming complex later.\\nWith SLC, the outcomes are better and your options for next steps are better. If it fails, that’s OK; it’s a failed experiment. Both SLCs and MVPs will sometimes produce that result because the whole point is to experiment. But if a SLC succeeds, you’ve already delivered real value to customers and you have multiple futures available to you, none of which are urgent. You could build a v2, and because you’re already generating value, you have more time to decide what that should look like. You could even query existing customers to determine exactly what v2 should entail, instead of a set of alpha-testers who just want to know “when are you going to fix this broken thing?”\\nOr, you can decide not to work on it. Not every product has to become complex. Not every product needs new major versions every two quarters. Some things can just remain simple, lovable, and complete.\\nAsk your customers.

That is, “Rocks” means “stuff that takes a few quarters,” “Pebbles” means “a few sprints,” and “Sand” means “less than a sprint.”\\nThis misses the most important point of work-ordering: It’s about maximizing impact by not allowing the easy or urgent things to crowd out the strategic things that take years to unfold but are more important than everything else combined. A thousand “quick wins” do not create durable advantages or fulfill a long-term vision.\\nAnother mistake is to think that the previous paragraph is the end of the story. “Schedule revenue-growth stuff, then maintenance updates, got it.” No. Each type of work requires different prioritization frameworks, has different goals, and hide different traps that make you unwittingly ineffective.\\nIf you pretend these differences don’t exist, your team will be working hard and delivering lots of code-commits—the appearance of “productivity”—but they’ll feel like they’re not making progress fast enough, competition will start catching up, and they’ll (correctly) complain that they can’t see how their work is connected to the strategy.\\nThe good news is: It does not take additional time to do it right. This is an instance of “smarter, not harder.” You just need the right frameworks.\\nThree mindsets \\nA tabular summary is trite, but it’s a handy reference:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRocks\\nPebbles\\nSand\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffort\\n≥3 Months\\n1-4 Sprints\\n≤1 Sprint\\n\\n\\nMaximize\\nImpact\\nROI\\nThrough\\xadput\\n\\n\\nOutlook\\nLong-term\\nShort-term\\nImm\\xadediate\\n\\n\\nScope\\nStrategic\\nTactical\\nany\\n\\n\\nHow Decide\\nDe\\xadliberate\\nAna\\xadlytical\\nIn\\xadtuitive\\n\\n\\nRole of Exec\\nDecider\\nObserver\\nnone\\n\\n\\nRole of PM\\nDriver\\nDecider\\nDecider  (but engage devs)\\n\\n\\nBeware\\ninsufficient impact\\nover-esti\\xadmating  ROI\\nover-think\\xading /  over-plan\\xadning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we’ll justify and explain how to use this to maximum effect, each stone in turn.\\nRocks maximize Impact \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuration: 3-12 months \\nRocks take the most time; let’s call it 3-6 months. Long projects are not only expensive, they’re also most likely to over-run, because they’re the most complex, contain the most unknowns, and have the most dependencies. So it’s really 3-12 months.\\n\\nHofstadter’s Law\\nIt always takes longer than you expect, even when you take Hofstadter’s Law into account.\\n\\nWell-oiled agile teams will point out they can hit earlier deadlines by adjusting scope and pushing less-urgent items past the deadline. That’s wonderful for learning and customer-delight. But the leftover work still needs to be done, even if rearranged, so this doesn’t change the magnitude of the effort required to achieve the full effect of the idea. And anyway, there are good reasons why we’re consistently incapable of estimating big projects.\\nA team might only do a single Rock in a year—certainly no more than three—especially because other work also needs to get done. If you can do only one big thing this year, that thing had better be extraordinary.\\nMaximize impact \\nA Rock must deliver dramatic, measurable impact, not merely “incremental improvement.” It must be strategic, meaning that it must attack the most important challenges you face, materially advancing the company down its unique path for winning its corner of the market, leveraging existing advantages to reduce risk and to forge a path that others cannot easily follow, and build new durable advantages. This is where teams most often fall short: Not delivering enough impact to justify their investment of time.\\nSadly, big projects not only over-run on time, but also often under-deliver on impact1. These sorts of predictions are famously inaccurate. So it’s even more imperative that we demand an enormous impact: That way, if we under-achieve, it was still worth the time.\\n\\n1\\n Fortunately, on occasion they can over-deliver by an order of magnitude or two; this is always the post hoc story of a successful company, the founders shaking their heads saying they never believed it would be this successful.\\nCrucially, and perhaps controversially: Do not maximize ROI2. Your primary job is to execute your strategy to the fullest, spending the most-possible time on the most-impactful thing. If an idea is less impactful, yet also quicker to achieve, that is not the right choice. When things go worse than planned, that “less impact” turns into “incremental impact,” and you cannot spend half a year on something so trivial.\\n\\n2\\n ROI is “Return on Investment,” computed as a measure of impact divided by a measure of effort, resulting in a measure of efficiency, i.e. “value per sprint.” (Whatever “value” means.)\\nBeware: “Maximizing impact” is harder than you think \\nThe most common problem is executing Rocks that aren’t impactful enough. The Rock claims to “make a difference,” but not enough difference, and after a few years, it feels like “we’re not moving fast enough” or “why isn’t revenue higher” even though the work from engineering is high-quality and stories are duly delivered every sprint.\\nHofstadter’s Law applies not only to the time-estimate, but to the impact-estimate, and thus to the height of the bar that need to set: It must be higher than you think, even when you take Hofstadter’s Law into account. Over-shooting is the antidote to Hofstadter’s Law.\\nEven if your ideas aren’t good enough, you will be tempted to select the most impactful idea on the list and just do it. This is a mistake. It’s such a common mistake, it is a cliché: “Good” is the enemy of “Great.” You have to face the truth: Your biggest problem is a lack of a truly great idea, and you must solve that rather than embarking on a long, misguided journey. The team can do Pebbles and Sand in the meantime, thus staying productive, while also helping ideate and validate better ideas.\\nDeliberative decision-making process \\nBecause you’re committing so much of the team’s life3, and because you have to be so confident that the Rock is strategic and impactful, you need to spend time on this decision up-front. This is not an “agile” decision, it’s a strategic one. Once the direction is set, the big picture is clear, the mountain you want to climb is identified, then it is ideal to be “agile” in how you climb it. Execution details are never certain; backtracking is necessary. But if you’re climbing up the wrong mountain in the first place, being “agile” doesn’t help; the result is a team self-managing themselves into a mediocre, unfulfilling result. Although most decisions should be fast, sometimes they should be slow; Rocks should be slow, or at least deliberate.\\n\\n3\\n Agilists argue that if you find yourself part-way through a failing project, you can just abort, because “that’s agile.” That’s true, and that’s smarter than plodding forward in a sunk-cost refusal to face reality, but on a human level it is demoralizing and ruins trust to abruptly cancel a project a team has been laboring on for months, “because we’re agile.” Canceling is necessary, but not free, so you should act as if a Rock is a one-way door.\\nUse this framework to select the most impactful idea: Binstack: Making a maximal multi-dimensional decision. This process enshrines “impact” as the highest priority, allows other dimensions to participate but neither confuse nor dominate the decision, and produces a pithy, clear explanation of the decision at the end.\\nIf you’re not coming up with good-enough ideas in the first place, try these prompts. But also consider whether the real problem is that your strategy is too vague.\\nExecs decide, but ideally PMs are in command \\nRocks materially advance the strategy, and executives4 ultimately own the strategy. So, ultimately the final decision of what Rock to execute rests with the executive. In practice, however, the PM should be in command of the strategy and the ideas, driving the discussion and the decision. Ideally5 the PM is actually in command, and the executive is happy to play the role of coach and Devil’s Advocate during the decision process, and to sign off on a well-thought-out proposal.\\n\\n4\\n At a smaller company, this means whoever has the executive role, whoever is running all of Product, or R&D, or the CTO, or the CEO.\\n5\\n We won’t cover workplace dynamics in this article, so suffice to say that this is what “healthy” looks like, and the further reality is from ideal, the more one or both parties needs to change.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nSand maximizes Throughput \\nBecause Pebbles are the Goldilocks of work-items, it’s instructive to leap over them and solve for the smallest items, establishing bookends around the middle-child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuration: ≤1 sprint \\nSand are items that don’t need to be broken down. They’re short, and typically “just need to be done” without discussion or ado. They can’t take longer than a sprint; sometimes they take less than an hour.\\nThere are a million little things that are individually unmeasurable but that add up to a significant impact. Great user interfaces require a hundred tweaks to attain greatness. High-quality error-handling requires esoteric corner-case unit-tests. High performance is often the result of innumerable optimizations. High-quality code means fixing myriad little bugs, some of which customers never experienced. Continuous, low-risk tech-debt reduction requires a hundred small refactorings. Security patches and library upgrades are mandatory maintenance. Documentation tweaks are helpful, low-risk, and should be done continuously. Great writing in general requires myriad tweaks, not grand organizational “pivots;” most edits to this document change a single sentence.\\nIn bulk, Sand is mandatory for wonderful, high-quality software. When you use a piece of software and say, “Wow, this is really well-done,” that’s a result of Sand. While each grain is typically impossible to “measure,” ignoring them means we will never attain greatness, even with the best strategy.\\nMaximize throughput \\nSand has a material impact only when executed en masse, as a sort of opposite to “death by a thousand cuts.” Therefore the goal is to maximize how many of them we fit into the interstitial spaces between the Rocks and Pebbles. The measure of success is throughput: How many we complete per sprint.\\nWe cannot—and should not—try to measure or prioritize “impact.” It’s too small to measure6. It’s enough to agree that fixing ten bugs this sprint is a great accomplishment, and that our customers and support techs will thank us for it.\\n\\n6\\n It is conceivable that two days’ work has a measurable impact on some metric. When you happen across one of these four-leaf clovers, you obviously should do it, regardless of whether you consider it Sand (because it’s fast) or a Pebble (because it has impact). The point is to grant yourself the grace for Sand to not have a measurable impact.\\nAlso, high-throughput is fulfilling and energizing for teams. It just feels good to cross lots of things off a list. Do not discount the importance of the feeling of productivity and usefulness.\\nBeware: Administrative overhead destroys throughput \\nExactly because each grain of Sand takes little time, management processes will dramatically bloat the total time from conception to prioritization to completion. Administration is the biggest impediment to throughput, therefore PM’s must ruthlessly fight against the natural urge to debate and arrange and carefully assess and estimate the work, instead of just going about the business of completing the work.\\nIf you’re using the same processes to prioritize and define Sand as to define Pebbles or Rocks, the process is wrong. Add up the time you debate the merits, craft templated user stories, fill out the fields in JIRA, vote and prioritize into this sprint then re-prioritize into the next and the next, and assign and balance work across people. Don’t forget to multiply meeting time by the number of people in the meeting. This can easily occupy more time than it takes to complete the item in the first place.\\nSand will often originate from engineering; notice how many of the examples above are internal requirements for great software development rather than customer-driven requests. In these cases, it’s often a waste of time to perform the usual formalities like user-story-writing, because the engineers already know what to do, and why. You can observe this waste in senseless force-feeding of uninformative “proper product language” and template-filling, e.g.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nType:\\nTask\\n\\n\\nPriority:\\nModerate\\n\\n\\nSource:\\nEngineering\\n\\n\\nEstimate:\\n1h\\n\\n\\nMust-do by:\\n2022-03-15\\n\\n\\nStory:\\nAs a software developer I want to upgrade npm package minimist from version 1.2.2 to 1.2.3 so that I don’t have a security vulnerability.\\n\\n\\nLinked Goal:\\nAdhere to corporate security policies of applying security patches within thirty days of a known vulnerability of “low” severity and “low” risk.\\n\\n\\nRisks:\\nMight break unit tests, might require refactoring around new APIs or behaviors, might delay other work scheduled in the sprint\\n\\n\\nTesting Considerations:\\nNormal unit tests\\n\\n\\nAcceptance Criteria:\\nNothing changes after the upgrade\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt can get much worse, all for something that could just be a one-liner to “upgrade minimist to at least v1.2.3 because of a security patch,” and in practice the work will usually be done in a few minutes, changing one line in package.json and re-running the unit-tests.\\nPrioritize with intuition and desire, not math and metrics \\nBecause Sand is largely un-measurable, complex prioritization systems won’t produce meaningful results. Fortunately, exactly because they don’t take long to implement, it’s typically not important when they’re done, and indeed many never will get done because we always have more ideas than time.\\nTherefore, this is a great opportunity to engage people’s emotions, and go with things people want to do. Since delivered-value is near-nil, why not choose things people have energy for? This increases happiness, morale, and often quality. Because people naturally work harder and better on things they want to do, you get “productivity for free,” which in turn increases throughput, which is the primary goal.\\nSelf-managed teams schedule their own Sand \\nIn keeping with the rule to minimize administrative overhead, teams should schedule Sand themselves, not debate prioritization with executives.\\nIf the management is constantly engaged in Sand-scheduling, something is amiss and needs to be corrected, and it’s always the manager’s fault. Perhaps the team is perfectly capable of scheduling Sand; in that case, the manager is micro-managing, which is the manager’s fault. Perhaps the team really doesn’t understand the customer, the market, the technology, or the work, and therefore truly is incapable of scheduling Sand; in that case, the manager has hired incorrectly or not created an environment where the team can understand these things, which is the manager’s fault.\\nLittle requests and suggestions are normal; indeed, these will come from all over the organization. But if you’re debating with spreadsheets and virtual-sticky-note-boards, it’s gone too far.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nPebbles maximize ROI \\nPebbles are not a “balance” between Rocks and Sand; they are their own creatures. Their timeframe is definitionally constrained between that of Sand and Rocks; the more important difference is that while Rocks are strategic, with a view towards winning over the next few years, Pebbles are tactical wins that have an impact in the next few months, attacking the challenges you’re facing right now, or a great feature idea you can surprise customers with sooner than they expect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuration: 1-4 sprints \\nPebbles take multiple stories and possibly sprints. Unlike Sand, they do need to have a measurable impact; you can’t spend a month or two of the team’s time and have nothing objective to show for it.\\nIt is difficult to craft great Pebbles, because impactful things have a tendency to explode in effort. Anything longer than four sprints invokes the Hofstadter problem of time and impact, and therefore must be analyzed and prioritized as a Rock. If a Pebble starts expanding, you have two choices:\\n\\nReduce the scope of the idea so it can be achieved in a smaller timeframe, or\\nMove the item into the “Rocks” category, where it will be prioritized appropriately.\\n\\nIn both cases, you often discover that the impact is no longer big enough7. Either this means the team needs to get more creative in how to deliver more impact with less effort, or maybe this idea simply isn’t a good-enough use of your time.\\n\\n7\\n For (1), reducing scope might also reduce impact, in number of customers affected or in the magnitude of the effect. For (2) the impact might have been great for a one-month project, but too small when compared to other large projects.\\nPebbles maximize ROI \\nIf Rocks maximize strategic impact over the long-term, Pebbles maximize immediate impact in the short-term. Said another way: They are the “most effective use of the team’s precious time.”\\nPebbles maximize ROI: A measure of value, divided by a measure of effort, resulting in a metric of efficiency. Modest value won in a short time, or more value over more time, are both great uses of time. What you cannot do is deliver little value but still take a long time.\\nBeware the surprisingly high impact of estimation error on ROI \\nThe Hofstadter problem is magnified with ROI calculations, so you have to be especially careful, especially with classic frameworks like rubrics.\\nFor example, consider a task that ends up producing 20% less impact and ended up taking 50% more time than expected—a common real-world result:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEstimated\\nActual\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImpact\\n60\\n48\\n\\n\\nEffort\\n4\\n6\\n\\n\\nROI:\\n15\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis item has half the ROI than we originally thought. This is an immense magnitude of error, swamping the signal you thought you computed. Many other items’ ROI will fall within this range of error, telling us that the noise from the error exceeds the signal from analysis. Which means the rubric is useless.\\nTo avoid this issue, use this framework for performing an ROI analysis.\\nProduct Managers decide Pebbles \\nYou could argue that the Product Manager’s most important job is to make decisions exactly like this one: Which Pebble will we tackle next?\\nUltimately it’s a judgement call: A synthesis of what customers need most, what competitors are doing, what is consistent with the strategy, what is best for company metrics, and what is best for customer delight. Input from many directions is appreciated, but one mind needs to make the call. That should be the mind closest to the customers, to the product, to the competitors, and to the market, not a drive-by decision from a manager, and not a hostage negotiation with engineers who would rather rewrite a whole module from scratch.\\nThat said, committing a few months of time to anything is a big decision, which means it should have a sensible justification, and some objective measure of impact so we can see whether this activity is having the desired effect. With “self-managed teams” comes not only the freedom to decide and act, but the responsibility to own the results.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nA simple sprint-planning system \\nHow can you put all this together in practice, in real sprint-planning?\\nSchedule things in this order, skipping one if there is insufficient capacity to make significant progress on it given the other items in the list, or if high-quality stories aren’t ready-to-work:\\n\\nTime-critical items, regardless of size. (Examples: security patches, bugs actively impacting customers, critical work for a launch or other event with an externally-imposed, immovable date)\\nOne or more stories from the current Rock.\\nOne or more stories from the current Pebble.\\nSand.\\n\\nLife is never as simple as that, so here’s how to manage the common issues:\\n\\n“Time-Critical” takes up so much time, we can’t make progress on Rocks and Pebbles\\nYou have a meta-problem: Your team doesn’t have enough time to be effective; solving this is now your top priority. This problem is even more important than your Rock, because in this condition you won’t actually complete any Rock. There are myriad causes, and maybe multiple simultaneously: Is it a problem of individual productivity, of the team owning too many things, of architectural dependencies, of the problem-domain requiring more people, of lacking specialized skill sets, of greater fortitude of saying “no” to certain requests, or what? You must diagnose and cure the disease. Schedule sprint time to work on the solution.\\nStarving the Rock\\nJust one story per sprint will cause too much context-switching, and take too much calendar-time. If you’re constantly starving your most strategic item, this is an impediment that the PM needs to address with the team. You’re probably falling prey to the Eisenhower Matrix fallacy of working on things that are urgent, rather than things that are important. Maybe you need to pause your Pebble for a while?\\nMore than one Pebble\\nIf you’re truly going to execute on all four sections, you don’t have time for two Pebbles at once. Plus, the context-switching is worse for morale and for productivity. The exception is when a Pebble is essentially complete, or will be blocked for at least a week, and therefore you truly do have the time to work on something else.\\nAlways the Rock, never the Pebble\\nBecause Sand is definitionally small, a few of those items always fit. But, a significant story for a Pebble may not. What if Pebble stories never fit? Consider that this might not actually be a problem, if the Rock is so valuable. Declaring the Rock “the theme of the next four months” might be exactly what the team needs for focus and maximum impact. It could be that once the Rock is “done” (in the sense of “first complete version”), you can then tackle a Pebble and then another, just doing incremental (small) updates to the Rock as you continue to learn and evolve its result, rather than immediately tackling an entirely new Rock.\\nZero Sand\\nSince it’s last on the list, and often aren’t even full stories, it’s easy to just never do Sand, but this will result in a poor product and unhappy engineers (as much of their internal work falls under this category). Consider toning down stories from other areas, maybe pausing the Rock or Pebble for one sprint, or even having a sprint devoted only to Sand, as a fun way to get a ton accomplished in a short amount of time and to break up the monotony of the sprint-planning cycle.\\nStarting a new Rock or Pebble too soon, rather than creating more quality and value from the ones that just “completed”\\nWith long lists of genuinely terrific Rocks and Pebbles, it’s tempting to start a new one as soon as the current one is complete. But software rarely works that way. Between learning how customers actually use (or don’t use) things in the field, completing small items that were originally deferred (so that we shipped sooner and started learning sooner and started selling the feature sooner), and both incremental and significant follow-on functionality, often you need to keep the Rock and Pebble around longer than it first seemed, or at least not start a new one quite yet. This is realistic for great software and a healthy, sustainable pace of work, and this is another reason why our “time estimates” on both Rocks and Pebbles are subject to Hofstadter’s Law, and further justifies our draconian admonitions about identifying and prioritizing that work.\\nTrying to “balance” every sprint\\nIt’s not important that every sprint is perfectly balanced between all types of work. It is important that we’re balanced over a period several months, otherwise something important is getting starved. Indeed, it’s often wise to build imbalanced sprints intentionally, because that means greater focus, less context-switching, and therefore getting more quality work done.\\n\\nOf course all this is easy to say, but hard to execute. Still, when we write it down as simply as possible, and try to honor it, we’ll make better decisions sprint by sprint, which in turn creates the most impact year by year.\\nIt’s tricky to navigate, but this framework will help you spend everyone’s time more wisely.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/rocks-pebbles-sand/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRocks, Pebbles, Sand: How to implement in practice\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Three mindsetsRocks maximize ImpactSand maximizes ThroughputPebbles maximize ROIA simple sprint-planning system\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Twitter’s limit of 140 characters, apparently uselessly trivial, created a uniquely addictive communications pattern, and meant it could be used even on cheap devices with cheap cellular plans.\\nThe story is always about how the company was amazing at one or two specific things. The story isn’t about the 47 complex details that all added up, and isn’t about a 28-page strategy document.\\nThe story is also never about how the company “shored up weaknesses.” Twitter had massive weaknesses, like constantly going off-line:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nTwitter Fail Whale circa 2010\\n\\n\\nFundamental issues like downtime and security flaws do need to be solved, but that’s not a strategy, it’s an operational necessity. Facebook famously made this point when they pioneered the catchy motto “Move fast and break things,” explaining that rapid innovation is more important than anything else:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBooks were written extolling the benefits and wisdom of this admonition:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcept, once you’re no longer a scrappy startup, it’s not smart at all. The Fail Whale is not OK. Not even for Facebook, who officially changed their motto more than a decade ago:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nNo one wrote a book about the new motto. Even Zuck couldn’t bring himself to write out the word “infrastructure.”\\n\\n\\nFacebook didn’t defeat MySpace because of stable infrastructure or breaking things; they won because of their strengths in hypergrowth. Twitter continued to grow during the many years of Fail Whale because of its unique communications experience.\\nReversing weakness is hard, painful, likely to result in something merely neutral, not great, and is at high risk of failing completely. Leveraging our innate greatness is “how we will win,” and “how we will win” is the entire purpose of a strategy.\\nThis is why typically the best answer to “what tool/language/framework/process should I use to do ______?” is “the one you already know1.” That’s the one that best leverages your time—your most limited resource.\\n\\n1\\n Slack was famously built in PHP, a language derided at the time as passé. But PHP is what the founders knew, and customers don’t care either way. Facebook used PHP too; when they scaled and needed more performance, they invented their own version of PHP. Expensive, yes, but companies that never get off the ground never earn the “good problems to have” of scaling.\\nOccasionally you do need to correct a strategic weakness in order to win. Not an operational weakness like “unstable infrastructure,” but one where you’re constantly losing deals to a competitor, due to a major deficiency in product or positioning. Something where we need to change “who we are” in order to win.\\nA good strategy will explain why this risky, difficult, unnatural, expensive journey must nevertheless be undertaken, and why it’s the best way to win. There must not be many; probably not more than one. You can’t afford the time, people, or energy.\\nBetter is to avoid weaknesses through decisions on target market, target personas, and product. So if your weakness is that you cannot supply 24/7 customer service like some competitors, call yourself a “boutique,” meaning a business where customers have incredible interactions with experts, but of course those experts are available only at limited times. If your weakness is a small team who can’t build millions of features, make a product targeting users who have simple needs and appreciate simple, well-built software that “doesn’t have all that crap I don’t want.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome weaknesses can be debilitating if they cross some threshold, but otherwise they should be ignored; uptime is one of them. For these types, at WP Engine we’ve had great success with the system of SLO management from Google’s SRE Book2; while written about infrastructure, it’s a general-purpose system for managing things that should be satisfied rather than maximized.\\n\\n2\\n You define a metric that measures the effect in question (e.g. “uptime in past 28 days”), and you define the acceptable threshold (e.g. “99.5%”). The rule is: while the metric exceeds the threshold, we do not attempt to improve it—that’s like over-investing in a weakness that will never become a strength. But if the metric drops below the threshold, the team addresses it—that solves for the “minimum acceptable weakness.” By being objective and explicit about when we invest, we invest just the right amount, at the right times. Imagine a downtime incident, with emotions running and and demands that “we must invest so this never happens again.” That’s when you need a previously-agreed-upon decision-making rule.\\nA cross-functional team meets quarterly to agree on the threshold; this way, when some downtime happens, and everyone is emotional and demanding that “something must be done, so this never happens again,” you can go back to your rule and point\\nLeverage isn’t just about strengths; it can also come from the business model. A common business model amongst self-funded entrepreneurs is a product with near-zero marginal cost3. Software works this way, and also content: blogs, newsletters, podcasts, videos, books, courseware. A newsletter written for 100 people takes the same effort as for 100,000, yet the latter can generate 1000x more revenue. This is why a self-funded a content company is difficult at first (all effort, no income, no compounding effects) but can be extremely profitable if it takes off (far more revenue for the same effort and almost the same costs).\\n\\n3\\n Meaning: Creating the first copy of the thing might be expensive, but selling the next copy of the thing costs almost nothing.\\nLeverage can also come from supporting tools. As of this writing, AI can generate a simple blog post, albeit with factual errors, no personal examples, and a plodding style. But, AI can draft ten articles, and a human can edit those many times faster than generating them from scratch, resulting in a large increase in output. Similarly, a great strategy might mandate the creation of a specific supporting system that doesn’t just “make us more efficient,” but makes us 10x more efficient, and therefore becomes a new form of leverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPassion is leverage. Your strengths are magnified through sheer will, and that same energy helps you plow through the emotional pain and drudgery of working through challenges. This is why “follow your passion” is correct but incomplete.\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect.\\n—Raymond Joseph Teller (of Penn & Teller)\\n\\n\\nLeveraging differentiated strengths \\nThe kinds of strengths we’ve just identified are good, but your competitors have those kinds of strengths too. (You’re not the only organization with “super-talented, passionate engineers,” and all content companies have a leveraged business model.)\\nThe more important strengths separate your organization from others. These are more strategic, because they help you win against the competition, not just by leveraging your time.\\nIt’s simple conceptually; these are the clichéd “differentiated competitive advantages” or “unique selling propositions.” The simplicity is deceptive: it is difficult to invent differences which aren’t trivial, and that also apply to most of your target audience. This difficulty is why these need to be identified in the strategy; we won’t just happen across these by accident during day-to-day work.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack where you are strong and the enemy is weak; do not attack where the enemy is strong and you are weak.\\n—Sun Tzu, Art of War\\n\\n\\nTechnology and design choices can create competitive differentiation. A technical architecture will make some features and capabilities easy, and others difficult or impossible4. A design can make certain use-cases obvious and delightful, while others are annoying or impossible. There is no such thing as technology or design that makes no trade-offs. Great strategy names those trade-offs, shows how they align with the target market and target persona, and therefore how you’ll exploit those trade-offs to win5, while competitors who made different trade-offs won’t be able to follow, at least not at extreme cost and taking far more time just to catch up to where you already are today.\\n\\n4\\n Heroku invented the now-ubiquitous idea of the 12-factor application, but only after mandating a combination of trade-offs which many Rails developers initially hated, like requiring Bundler for package management (back when Bundler was bad), mandating PostgreSQL instead of MySQL (back with the latter was 10x more common), and disallowing writing data to disk. Developers ultimately accepted these restrictions because taken together they enabled a new way to develop, test, stage, deploy, and scale applications. Today, nearly all SaaS applications follow the 12-factor principles, and Heroku cleanly won the Rails market for a decade.\\n5\\n But also, how those trade-offs create limitations or problems for you, that you will need to accept. You must not call it a “bug” when those limitations appear. They are the consequence of leaning into your strengths, and trying to “fix” them will take inordinate effort, they will not result in a fantastic product, they blunt the power of your strengths, and they remove time and energy that could have been spent magnifying those strengths.\\nA specific type of technical differentiation is solving a particularly difficult engineering problem6. This has the advantage that, if you succeed, you might have created a moat (e.g. Google search, Tesla cars, OpenAI). The disadvantage is that it is likely to fail: take too long, take too much money, not actually solve the difficult puzzle, not do enough of what the customer needs. Therefore, you should be surgical about which subset of the software should be difficult: Something that creates a competitive moat and that leverages some strengths or assets.\\n\\n6\\n Google Wave was supposed to change everything: Replacing chat, email, word-processing, spreadsheets, file-storage, note-taking, wikis, and websites. Built as the conceptual precursor to Google Docs, it was the first product with remarkably fast multi-user simultaneous editing; you could watch people type character-by-character. The technology was fantastically difficult; no one else had it, and it would be years before anyone else did. Unfortunately it was so difficult that it failed, but this proved the rule that, had they succeeded, it would have created long-term differentiating leverage; project co-founder Lars Rasmussen said it was so difficult, that even if they were allowed to it all over again, with the same team, with all the knowledge they now possessed, it would again take years to execute, and still probably wouldn’t have worked. That means the competition would have failed too.\\nBesides “big awesome features,” another kind of differentiated advantage is an insight—when you understand an important truth while the rest of the world does not, or especially if the rest of the world confidently believes the opposite to be true7. Their disbelief prevents competition. Once proved true, others will follow8, but it’s too late; the strategy has already been a success. Made famous as Peter Thiel’s “Secret,” these are rare but valuable insights that underpin some of the most famous and successful corporate strategies.\\n\\n7\\n “People will buy shoes over the internet.” [Zappos] // “People will take rides from strangers.” [Uber, Lyft] // “People want to sleep in stranger’s houses.” [AirBnB] // “Rockets can be reusable.” [SpaceX] // “The highest-performing sedan can be battery-powered.” [Tesla] // “People communicating in 140-character chunks can topple governments.” [Twitter] // “Large enterprises will acquiesce to putting their customer data ‘in the cloud’ (a term we just invented).” [Salesforce] // “Open source copycats will defeat multi-billion-dollar incumbents.” [RedHat]\\n8\\n Only after Salesforce convinced the world that SaaS is viable, nearly all software companies copied the model. Only after Linux defeated IBM, Sun, HP, and everyone else, there’s now an open-source copycat of everything ever invented. Only after RedHat successfully monetized “free” open source software, reaching tens of billions of market-cap, did investors “open source companies” now resulting in hundreds of billions dollars of market capitalization.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nUnfortunately, differentiation tends to erode over time, sometimes rapidly. “Secret insights” make themselves known over time, and almost anything in software can be copied. Patents are supposed to provide protection, but what software company prevents copycats through patents?\\nTherefore, most valuable, strategic differentiation is of a kind which takes decades to erode, if ever.\\nLeveraging durable differentiated strengths \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most important thing to me is figuring out how big a moat there is around the business. What I love, of course, is a big castle and a big moat with piranhas and crocodiles.\\n—Warren Buffett\\n\\n\\nThe word for a durable differentiated advantage is a “moat.” Moats often take the form: “I have something that you don’t, and furthermore, you either don’t have the ability to acquire it, won’t invest enough to achieve it, or in the case that you try, you would have to make an incredible investment of time and energy and possibly brand adjustment to do it, which is unlikely to succeed, and even if it does succeed it will take years, by which time we’ve already won.”\\nVisit this companion article about moats for examples, including a worked case-study.\\nBesides those classic moats, a special and often-overlooked form of durable differentiation is to exploit an ossified structure in a competitor, where they cannot react even if they wanted to.\\n\\nA competitor with a high cost structure must charge high prices, therefore a strategy of have “40% of the features at 10% of the price” leverages a point of differentiation that the competitor cannot match. This is simplistic form of Innovator’s Dilemma disruption.\\nA competitor with a simple product and no tech support won’t be able to win complex clients with complex needs, therefore a strategy of “Enterprise offering at Enterprise prices” leverages differentiation that competitor cannot match.\\nA competitor who loudly, publicly espouses a set of values cannot take actions contrary to those values, therefore a strategy that espouses a contrary set of values will remain differentiated9.\\nA competitor who invests in a core platform with specific trade-offs will not be able to change those trade-offs for years, if ever; therefore selecting different trade-offs, resulting in different product features (and liabilities), will remain differentiated.\\nA competitor whose profit is driven by a specific product cannot lower prices when another company decides to build that same product for free as a loss-leader that powers a different line of business:\\n\\nNetscape (revenue from selling a browser) was killed by Microsoft with IE (loss-leader for Windows)\\nFor-profit smartphone operating systems were killed by Google with Android10 (loss-leader for the Google ecosystem of services)\\nTwenty proprietary Unix operating systems were killed by RedHat with Linux (loss-leader for RedHat’s Enterprise Services, later sold for $34B)\\nQuoting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on his strategic approach with Bing, “There is such margin in search, which for us is incremental. For Google it’s not, they have to defend it all.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n A company who values sustainable sourcing cannot price-compete with those who lack that value; conversely a sustainable-sourcing-minded consumer will buy from the former despite the expense.\\n10\\n Except Apple of course; still, 87% of global handsets are Android, and Apple arguably remained because of the hardware more than the operating system.\\nFinally, in a crowded competitive space, it’s possible that no single thing is completely unique, much less durable. A combination of multiple things taken together can be both differentiated and durable, so long as the constituents form a mutually-reinforcing, cohesive structure, in which a competitor who successfully copied a fraction of the structure will still not have created a similar product11.\\n\\n11\\n This idea is also explored in Blue Ocean Strategy, though it originated years earlier as in the example below.\\nConsider the example of Southwest Airlines, a low-cost US airline with an incredible business model, remaining profitable even during the US terrorists attacks of September 2001 and throughout the Great Recession of 2008, across a period where every other major US airline filed for bankruptcy at least once.\\nSouthwest doesn’t have any one thing that is completely unique in the industry, and certainly nothing that a competitor couldn’t copy if they wanted to, but it does have a combination of decisions, features, strengths, and even weaknesses, that together are unique, have been durable for sixty years, and explains their success. Michael Porter diagrammed this combination in 1996; his analysis is remains accurate more than twenty years later, underscoring its durability:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nMichael Porter’s “Activity Systems Map” for Southwest Airlines\\n\\n\\nNotice how some attributes would be considered strengths by a customer (e.g. low ticket prices and frequent, reliable departures), while others are weaknesses (e.g. no meals, no baggage transfers, no connections to other airlines, no long-haul routes). The key is that all decisions support a common structure, e.g. the lack of amenities is part of what allows them to have lower prices, and short-hauls on standardized aircraft (which helps with cost-reduction) also leads to frequent, reliable departures (that customers love).\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategy is a set of interrelated and powerful choices that positions the organization to win.\\n—Roger Martin\\n\\n\\nIt’s easy to claim that “our peculiar set of features makes us unique,” but that’s not strategic unless it forms a mutually-reinforcing network, including weaknesses. It’s not durable leverage unless a written strategy explains this network, so that the company can continue to reinforce the entire network with its actions and investments, including accepting the weaknesses, not treating them as “bugs to be fixed.”\\nOtherwise, it’s just a pile of features.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGive me a long enough lever and I shall move the world.\\n—Archimedes\\n\\n\\nWithout leveraging strengths (rather than spending far more energy shoring up a weakness that still won’t be great), the company will not succeed in creating something great.\\nWithout leveraging differentiated strengths, the company will not surpass competitors, will have a hard time winning and keeping customers, and will have an even harder time justifying profit-generating prices.\\nWithout leveraging durable, differentiated strengths, the company’s success will be short-lived, differentiation will be temporary, and once again it will be reduced to out-spending on marketing or lowering prices until it is unprofitable.\\nA winning strategy explains which strengths the company will leverage, how it will side-step rather than “attack” its weaknesses, which strengths can be leveraged for differentiated sales today, and which long-term moats the company is constructing.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/leverage/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe three kinds of leverage that anchor effective strategies\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Leveraging strengthsLeveraging differentiated strengthsLeveraging durable differentiated strengths\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

All the acronyms are new and unfamiliar; this is tricky, but exciting! Someday, Charlie’s website might grow large enough to exceed the free tier—let’s hope!\\nApparently, what Charlie is doing is:\\n★ Buy infrastructure: web server, disk space, networking, database.\\nNominally this is true, but Charlie’s life ambition is not “to buy infrastructure.” In fact, it’s a means to and end. What Charlie really wants is to have a functioning WordPress-based website, because WordPress is by an order of magnitude the most popular1 way for people to easily write and publish content, and integrate with online marketing software needed to build a successful website.\\n\\n1\\n 43% of the largest 10,000,000 websites use WordPress; Shopify is the next largest with 4%. (source)\\nSo, a better way to explain what’s happening, is that Charlie has a higher-level “need,” which is to set up a WordPress site. Getting the infrastructure is a means to an end, rather than the end itself; in this sense, it’s a “need” but it’s lower in the “stack.”\\nWhat Charlie is doing really is:\\n★ Set up a WordPress site.\\n→ Buy infrastructure: web server, disk space, networking, database.\\nThis might sound like a verbose restatement of Jobs to be Done or Five Why’s, but there’s a strategic competitive insight lurking here, which companies often fail to appreciate, at their peril:\\nCharlie never wanted to set up infrastructure, and still doesn’t. Charlie wants a WordPress site. Therefore, a company who provides the higher-level need of “WordPress site” makes the lower-level need of “infrastructure” obsolete.\\nSpecifically, when a company like WP Engine makes it possible to set up a WordPress site in one minute, with no infrastructure to think about, handling all the technology and 24/7 monitoring, and customer support that helps with WordPress, then that company is going to win Charlie’s business, and AWS will never see Charlie.\\nCharlie disappears from the cloud infrastructure market. This is the insight.\\nIf you ask AWS who their competitors are, the answer are other cloud infrastructure suppliers like GCP (Google), Azure (Microsoft), and Digital Ocean. And they are correct, because the Charlies of the world who do buy infrastructure, will buy from one of those. But WP Engine is also a competitor of AWS when it comes to Charlie, not because WP Engine competes on infrastructure (which it doesn’t, and in fact WP Engine itself buys infrastructure from AWS, GCP, and Azure!), but because WP Engine targets a higher-level “need” in the stack.\\nBut you can’t stop there. That’s the trouble—you always want to stop when you’ve reached the level you operate on, but there’s always another level.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstagram’s real product isn’t photos; it’s likes.\\n—Alex Danco\\n\\n\\nIt’s not Charlie’s life ambition to make a WordPress site; this is just a means to an end. What Charlie really wants is to have a personal website for content and self-promotion. Charlie wants to carve out a digital pied à terre. In the virtual universe there’s infinite terre, so why not slap your pied on some of it!\\nNow the Needs Stack becomes:\\n★ Have a personal website for content and self-promotion.\\n→ Set up a WordPress site.\\n→ Buy infrastructure: web server, disk space, networking, database.\\nCharlie can still achieve this higher-level need with WordPress running on WP Engine—indeed, over one million websites run this way today. But there are alternatives that target this higher-level need. Wix and Squarespace both let you create websites without WordPress, cutting out the step of “get WordPress” just as WP Engine cut out the step of “get infrastructure.”\\nDoes this mean WP Engine no longer has a business? No, that’s not the conclusion, any more than you should conclude that AWS no longer has a business. WP Engine is 14 years old and still healthy, growing, and profitable; AWS just posted $5.2B in profit just last quarter. So what’s going on?\\nThese alternatives to WordPress certainly have advantages, but they are worse than WordPress for long-form content and for customizability. For this reason, they might not be right for Charlie. But they are competitors. Similarly, WP Engine doesn’t let you customize your infrastructure, so those who need to do so, still need to buy directly from AWS.\\nThe pattern here is the next insight: Up the stack, customers achieve their end-goal faster; down the stack, customers have more flexibility and customization.\\nBut wait… once again “having a personal website” is not Charlie’s life ambition, but rather just a means to an end. Charlie really wants a a book deal. Being a properly-published author with a hard-back volume on the shelf that you can show to your kids (who will just shrug today but maybe someday they’ll appreciate it), and that you can gaze upon now and then in your dotage as a great accomplishment. This is Charlie’s personal idea of “successful and popular.” The way to get a book deal is to already have an online following; you’ll have honed your writing craft, you’ll have a natural audience to kick-start sales, and the fact that you’ve won followers in the competitive, noisy Internet proves your content is worth reading. Publishers want authors whose content has been de-risked and who come with a built-in marketing channel.\\nSo the Needs Stack deepens:\\n★ Become a popular content-producer, leading to a book deal.\\n→ Have a personal website for content and self-promotion.\\n→ Set up a WordPress site.\\n→ Buy infrastructure: web server, disk space, networking, database.\\nThe new layer brings new alternative solutions. There are companies like Substack, purpose-built to help you gain a following, with the tools for long-form content, for building a mailing list, and for promoting your content on social media.\\nSubstack doesn’t automatically win, because WordPress is better than Substack in many ways. For example, WordPress is far more configurable, so you can make it look unique, unlike a million newsletters at Substack that all look identical (with character-kerning that’s too wide for my taste, but I’m biased). Also, the tools for long-form writing in WordPress are far superior, with drag-and-drop elements supporting complex layouts—including different layouts for phones versus tablets versus laptops—that an email newsletter cannot support. If Charlie values those things, then WordPress is still the right choice.\\nThis again exemplifies the pattern that software at higher levels of the Needs Stack have fewer features and less customization than software lower on the Stack. In exchange for these limitations, their focus on the higher-level Need means it’s easier for the customer to achieve that Need. If the ease of achieving the Need is more important to a customer than the ability to customize and extend, the higher-level product makes all lower levels obsolete.\\nBut wait a minute Substack because—you guessed it—there’s another level to Charlie’s Needs Stack. Because while Charlie wants a book deal as a signifier of popularity and success, it’s not Charlie’s life ambition. Charlie really wants to become a famous speaker. It started at a Tony Robbins show; Charlie instantly knew that the stage was their calling. It’s the prestige of being “that person” at parties, and the idea of being a jet-setter in first-class and a black car to pick you up with your name in the window, the ego basking in the glow of the lights and the elevation of the stage, gazed upon by an adoring audience who rushes up afterwards to grab a selfie and nervously blurt out a fraction of a story about how the speaker changed their life.\\nAnd the money.\\n★ Get lucrative speaking gigs around the world.\\n→ Become a popular content-producer, leading to a book deal.\\n→ Have a personal website for content and self-promotion.\\n→ Set up a WordPress site.\\n→ Buy infrastructure: web server, disk space, networking, database.\\nCharlie’s plan isn’t bad, but what if it were possible to skip the website and years of writing and self-promotion and the book deal and the two years of labor creating the book and directly become the next Tony Robbins? It’s not impossible; there are speaker bureaus and online services like SpeakerMatch that help you find gigs and facilitate the transaction. Why spend years building an online following (if you’re lucky) when you could spend that time creating inspirational presentations, delivering them to acclaim, earning testimonials for your next gig, building a reputation with an agency, and getting bigger and better gigs over time. In this scenario, Substack, Squarespace, WP Engine, and AWS are all irrelevant for Charlie; with the higher need met, the rest might as well not exist.\\nThe moral of the story is: You need to understand the Needs Stack of your target customers. Not just your “market” or your “product” or “solving the problem” or even the immediate Jobs-To-Be-Done of your customer—those are all means to ends.\\nAlready you can see how this will help you think about positioning and features; let’s see what else it helps you to do.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nHow to leverage the Needs Stack \\nThe solution to “selling benefits” vs “selling features” \\n“Sell benefits, not features” marketers have told us since the universe cooled enough for galaxies to form. We’re supposed to say “saves time” rather than showing a screenshot of the feature. (Or better yet, “grows revenue.”) For Charlie, say “Become famous” rather than “Get a website.”\\nAnd yet, does an Engineer looking for a database infrastructure solution really want to be told “saves time” or do they want to see specs and features? (A: Specs and features.)\\nIf a construction worker is looking for a wrench, do they search Google for “wrench that saves me time” or “socket wrench for a 5/16” lock nut?\" And when that person clicks a link to potentially buy the wrench, do they want pictures of happy people “saving time,” or do they want to see the specifications and features like “has a mounted light.” Do they really need to be told “the light is useful to see in dark corners?” Oh! Thanks for spelling out the benefits of photons!\\nSo which is it?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Needs Stack suggests an answer. Charlie is not constantly and consciously thinking “I gotta become Tony Robbins,” even though that’s the top of their Needs Stack. Charlie is thinking at some other level of the stack at any given moment, for example “I gotta get some content online.”\\nGoogle searches are a good proxy for “what level of the stack are potential customers operating at right now?” When Charlie embarked on this project, the search might have been something like “best way to publish online,” not “how to become a famous globe-trotting speaker.” After reading some articles about how WordPress is inexpensive, popular and has all the tools you need, maybe then Charlie moved down the Stack to search “how to get a WordPress site.”\\nIf someone has in their head “get a WordPress site,” you want to meet them where they are, and talk about how your product is the best way to “get a WordPress site.” That’s the part where you talk about features.\\nHowever, benefits still have a role to play, because it’s true that these features are a “means to an end,” and the more you convince the customer that you’re the best means to that end, you win even over alternatives. So, you can sell the benefits that are one level higher on the stack.\\nIn this case, you could imagine a home page message like: “Become famous online with our turn-key, customizable WordPress website.” That’s the benefit from one level above, promised as a consequence of the current level.\\nConversely, if you’re Substack, you can’t say “customizable” because that’s not what the product is, and it’s barely even a “website” (it’s just back-issues of your newsletter), but you can speak to the product “getting eyeballs.” So, that message could be “Grow your own audience with our turn-key newsletter platform.2”\\n\\n2\\n Sure enough, as of this writing the Substack homepage says: “Substack lets independent writers and podcasters publish directly to their audience and get paid through subscriptions,” which are benefits from one level higher (i.e. “be independent” and “get paid for writing”). Lower on the page it lists features from the level they are on: “A Substack combines a blog, newsletter, payment system, and customer support team—all integrated seamlessly with a simple interface. We handle the admin, billing, and tech.“\\nPosition lower levels as irrelevant \\nIf Substack tried to fight the battle at the “get a website” level of the stack, they would lose every time—it has almost no features of a modern website. But, it can fight the battle at the “build an audience” level; for some subset of the market, that’s a more relevant level. Therefore, the idea is to make all levels below that irrelevant, by focusing only on your benefits:\\n“While others just give you a website, we help you build a following.” Right, because “popularity” is what I wanted, not “a website!” This message won’t work on businesses, for example, because they actually do need a website. But for the aspirational speaker, this might be perfect.\\nConversely, WP Engine does the same thing with cloud services. The major cloud services say: “Oh it’s easy to have a WordPress site. You just click 17 times on all this stuff to make a server, and then download and install a bunch of stuff to create server software, then set up and configure WordPress, then use this 8-page tutorial to integrate with a fast caching network (which costs extra), then download and configure WordPress plugins to talk to the caching network, then stay on top of all the security patches and software upgrades, and it wouldn’t hurt you to learn how to SSH into your Ubuntu server so that….”\\nWhereas, the Managed WordPress Platform says: “You don’t want infrastructure, you want a WordPress site, and in less than one minute, you’ll have exactly that. And it’s faster and more secure than doing it yourself. And when you have trouble, you can call our support line, which cloud services don’t have.”\\nIn short, make “infrastructure” irrelevant by focusing on the next level up. The customer never wanted to think about infrastructure in the first place.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nAdd more value by moving up the hierarchy \\nIf products targeted at one level disrupt the products below them, there’s an obvious strategic conclusion: You could disrupt yourself and your competitors by moving up the hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are huge barriers to accomplishing this. The barriers are so large, companies almost never overcome them:\\n\\nThe next level is a different product, and a different business.\\nIf you’re known for selling WordPress sites, you’d have to re-brand to be known for building an audience, whether that’s actually a new brand or expanding an existing brand. You also need to become expert in what that product is, and build it3. You might need to change your business model, e.g. selling infrastructure by the gigabyte, versus selling whole websites by the month, versus selling new subscribers on a pay-for-performance basis, versus taking a percentage of speaking fees.\\n\\n\\n3\\n Or buy it, which mature companies often do, trading cash for speed-to-market.\\n\\nThe next level isn’t possible\\nIt’s not clear that one can build a product that fulfills the promise to get someone a substantial following. Twitter and Facebook sort of can, in that you can pay them to advertise your content. But the Internet is a large and noisy place; marketing software doesn’t automatically generate attention. Once you get the attention, if your content isn’t compelling, software can’t force people to subscribe. In short, if you go high enough in the Needs Stack, you might run into something that a product cannot produce. (Or at least you can’t.)\\nThe next level targets a smaller market\\nFew people share Charlie’s Needs Stack exactly. A business with a broad customer base like WP Engine sells an all-purpose platform for all kinds of sites. There are many different personas whose Needs Stack includes “set up a WordPress site4.” In each case, the “next level up” is different. Therefore, targeting a higher level also means narrowing the market. This might be wise—it is a tried-and-true strategy to be the best product in a smaller niche, rather than a small fish in a large, crowded ocean. But, a company who has an established brand in the wider market might not want to narrow into a sub-market. There might not be enough money in it.\\n\\n\\n4\\n e.g. individuals wanting attention, companies broadcasting their brand, media companies attracting eyeballs for advertising revenue, eCommerce stores using content-marketing to drive sales, communities using content to inform and engage, non-profits raising money, governments interacting with citizens\\nSince a full pivot is unlikely to succeed, there are other ways to build a strategy that partially climbs the hierarchy:\\n\\nCreate sub-brands / products\\nKeep the original business going, and launch “vertical” or “niche” products. Leverage the scale and operational excellence of the parent, but treat each product as its own “startup.”\\nAdd features without fully committing to the next level\\nPerhaps you can’t completely pivot to a product that promises subscriber-growth, but you could create an add-on product that helps someone do that. This becomes an extension of an existing product, aimed at personas who share that next level of their Needs Stack.\\nBetter marketing\\nAddress the need with words instead of features. Without “promising” results, you can help, educate, and lead in that area. You can have a field guide about how to attract and retain subscribers to a blog. You can give customers ideas for new kinds of content. You could partner with other companies who help with promotion. You could highlight customers who have been successful, wherein they share their experience to help others.\\n\\nStill, while this advice is good for most organizations who cannot completely move up the hierarchy, there are examples of fantastic businesses that succeeded exactly because they successfully made the transition. For example, all of the case studies given in the “Emotional vs Functional” chapter of Blue Ocean Strategy, such as Cemex selling “build an addition to your house, for your family” instead of just selling cement or Starbucks selling a lifestyle experience rather than B-grade coffee.\\nMeasure the next level up \\nThe perennial question: Which few key metrics measure whether the customer is deriving value from our product, and thus predict whether they’ll stay a customer? And beyond that, become a vocal advocate? The Needs Stack helps us uncover these more strategic metrics.\\nMetrics from the bottom of the Stack measure whether we’re operating well, and certainly this is necessary even if not sufficient. Metrics at the level the customer is actively thinking about are useful to measure whether our Product is delivering on its direct promise, which again is vital.\\nIt’s strategic to measure further up the stack. Not too far, otherwise it’s not only difficult to measure, but too many external factors drive the number. But the very next level up could be a critical way to measure value and to understand whether customers will be happy in the long run.\\nIf a customer of Shopify successfully creates a store, the product of “have a store online” is succeeding, and that will be reflected in metrics like “number of products currently for sale” and in user surveys like “how easy was it to set up products for sale.” That’s important, but what if no one buys their wares? That customer will probably churn, even though the software delivered on its promise. Indeed, Shopify has enormous cancellation rates that would sink most companies; they survive because the ones that stay, grow a lot. Because they have so many inbound new customers, they can manage around the fact that only 34% stick around for even one year.\\nCan Shopify ensure that all customers who create a store end up doing thousands of dollars a month in business? No, this is an example where the next level up is vital, but Shopify cannot control it. However, they can measure it, and help. They could have articles about how to do online marketing, or features inside the store that help potential customers complete a checkout rather than abandon5.\\n\\n5\\n Features like ShopPay, in which previous customers of other Shopify stores are fast-tracked through the purchase process, increasing the percentage of shopping carts that result in completed transactions.\\nThis is why Shopify’s primary success metric is GMV6; they report it to Wall Street directly after revenue, and in the same large font. GMV measures whether their customers are succeeding in the next level up on the stack. GMV not only reflects the truth about where the customer value is, it also encourages their product mangers to think about how to stretch up from the level of the stack they fully control.\\n\\n6\\n Gross Merchandise Value: the total amount of money their customers are selling through their stores.\\nA source of higher purpose \\nOur direct goals are often simple: Sign up more customers, get them to activate on the product, reduce churn, reduce support tickets, reduce costs. All of that is important, but none of it creates a higher purpose.\\nWhat’s it all for? Why should we even bother?\\nMany companies can’t answer the question. Indeed, maybe they have no purpose other than “growth.” Will folks be motivated to do their best work at a company that values only conversion rates?\\nPurpose can be found in the higher levels of the Needs Stack. The immediate work is “getting a website,” but the higher purpose is to enable someone to build a career for themselves, to engage their creativity and speciality, to help them win the respect of others. Or help them become a hero within a bigger organization through some new marketing project, which will eventually lead to their promotion. Or help them raise awareness and money for an important cause. Or enable them to speak truth to power in a region of the world where such speech is forbidden.\\nTell those stories. On the website and internally. Celebrate with your team when this actually happens for a customer, because that is what it’s all about. Those stories are why we should care.\\nIdentify those upper reaches of the Needs Stack, not only because it helps you build more valuable features, not only because it helps you build a better strategy, but because it is the ultimate reason why any of this is worth doing in the first place.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/needs-stack/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUsing the Needs Stack for competitive strategy\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)The Needs StackHow to leverage the Needs StackThe solution to “selling benefits” vs “selling features”Position lower levels as irrelevantAdd more value by moving up the hierarchyMeasure the next level upA source of higher purpose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

What’s real, and what’s random?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you read articles written by a founder who failed three times, never finding success?\\nNo, because you want to learn from success, not hear about “lessons learned” from a someone who hasn’t yet learned those lessons themself.\\nHowever, the fact that you are learning only from success is a deeper problem than you imagine.\\nSome stories will expose the enormity of this fallacy.\\nBullet holes: A brain teaser \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring World War II the English sent daily bombing raids into Germany. Many planes never returned; those that did were often riddled with bullet holes from anti-air machine guns and German fighters.\\nWanting to improve the odds of getting a crew home alive, English engineers studied the locations of the bullet holes. Where the planes were hit most, they reasoned, is where they should attach heavy armor plating. Sure enough, a pattern emerged: Bullets clustered on the wings, tail, and rear gunner’s station. Few bullets were found in the main cockpit or fuel tanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe logical conclusion is that they should add armor plating to the spots that get hit most often by bullets. But that’s wrong.\\nPlanes with bullets in the cockpit or fuel tanks didn’t make it home; the bullet holes in returning planes were “found” in places that were by definition relatively benign. The real data is in the planes that were shot down, not the ones that survived.\\nThis is a literal example of “survivor bias”—drawing conclusions only from data that is available or convenient and thus systematically biasing your results.\\nDoesn’t most business advice suffer from this fallacy? You read about successes but what about the businesses that “never made it home?” Like the downed planes, could failure contain more lessons than success?\\nBurying the other evidence \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScientific journals publish extraordinary results, so studies whose results are statistically insignificance aren’t published. Rather, they are abandoned or silently stowed away in academic filing cabinets.\\nFor this reason, this practice is called the “file-drawer effect,” and it’s a particularly insidious form of survivor bias because it is invisible. Peter Norvig sums it up nicely:\\n\\nWhen a published paper proclaims “statistically, this could only happen by chance one in twenty times,” it is quite possible that similar experiments have been performed twenty times, but have not been published.\\n\\nPharmaceutical companies have exploited this effect to skew results intentionally. It’s gotten so bad that journals are calling for a public database to prevent fraud:\\n\\nMore than two-thirds of studies of anti-depressants given to depressed children, for instance, found the medications were no better than sugar pills, but companies published only the positive trials.\\nIf all the studies had been registered from the start, doctors would have learned that the positive data were only a fraction of the total.\\n—Washington Post\\n\\nDoesn’t most business advice suffer from this fallacy? Harvard Business School’s famous case studies include only success stories. To paraphrase Norvig, what if twenty other coffee shops had the same ideas, same product, and same dedication as Starbucks, but failed? How does that affect what we can learn from Starbucks’s success?\\nExperimental proof of ESP \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDr. Joseph Rhine brought the rigor of experimental psychology to the study of the paranormal, and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) in particular. He made waves in the 1930s with controlled experiments testing whether a person was able to predict the order of the cards in a shuffled Zener deck (with symbols like circle, square, star, and wavy lines).\\nIn a typical experiment, 500 people are screened for “strong telepathic ability,” measured by significantly above-average performance in a 25-card deck. Those selected are tested again; most drop away. Tested a third time, perhaps one person passes again and we conclude that such a repeat performance is statistical evidence of genuine ESP.\\nTo see why this is just a different face of survivor bias, consider the following experiment. I believe some people are “heady” when it comes to coin-flipping—getting heads more often than chance alone would suggest. So I put 1000 people in a room and tell them to flip a coin ten times. Sure enough, a woman named Margaret makes “heads” ten times in a row! The chance of her getting heads ten times in a row is only 1-in-1024, so I conclude Margret has special abilities.\\nActually that last statement is true but misleading. The chance that Margaret would flip ten heads in a row is 1-in-1024, but that wasn’t the experiment I ran, was it? I let 1000 people flip and “found” Margaret in the crowd.\\nThe chance that somebody in a crowd of a thousand would flip heads ten times is a whopping 62%! Because so many people are attempting the feat, some normally-unlikely events will happen. This isn’t a test of Margaret’s abilities at all!\\nDoesn’t most business advice suffer from this fallacy? Take me for instance. I’ve started three1 consecutive successful companies, so that’s proof that I know what I’m doing and that you should do everything I say, right? Except maybe I’m just the one in the crowd who guessed right on the Zener cards three times, and there’s no reason to believe I would be successful a fourth time2.\\n\\n1\\n Author’s note in 2023: Now four with WP Engine; with 200,000 customers and hundreds of millions in ARR, and profitable, it’s an uber-Margaret!\\n2\\n Author’s Note in 2023: Looking back fourteen years, having done it again, I still wouldn’t change a word. Maybe I’m still Margaret. Perhaps I’ve earned additional benefit of the doubt, but the survivor bias warning remains.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nSpecific examples of survivor bias in business advice \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo far I’ve been asking rhetorically whether survivor bias might be severely skewing business advice. Steven Levitt (of Freakonomics fame) investigated this question directly.\\nHe was reading Good to Great by Jim Collins, a book that analyzed eleven companies that were mediocre—just pooping along—but then transformed themselves into stock market sensations. A conclusion was that the common trait was a “culture of discipline.” This book has sold many millions of copies, so it’s a good example of popular writing on business advice.\\nOne of the eleven “great” companies was Fannie Mae, and Steven Levitt was reading this book just as Fannie was collapsing in financial disaster. Hmm, he thought, I wonder how those other “great” companies are doing.\\nTurns out, had you invested in those eleven companies in 2001 (when the book came out), your portfolio would have underperformed the S&P 500! (Fannie Mae wasn’t even the only case of total disaster—also extolled was the now-bankrupt Circuit City.)\\nWhy didn’t these companies continue to succeed? It turns out Jim started by combing through 1435 companies looking for good candidates for the book, and picked eleven. It’s the ESP experiment all over again!\\nOn top of that, Jim doesn’t bother asking whether any of the 1424 other companies also displayed a “culture of discipline.” Maybe that’s something that many public companies have regardless of performance.\\nIs this book an aberration? Nope, Steven investigated another business book from the 1980s—In Search of Excellence—and found the same effect.\\nSteven then comes to the same conclusion that I’m coming to:\\n\\nThese business books are mostly backward-looking: what have companies done that has made them successful? The future is always hard to predict, and understanding the past is valuable; on the other hand, the implicit message of these business books is that the principles that these companies use not only have made them good in the past, but position them for continued success.\\n\\nTo the extent that this doesn’t actually turn out to be true, it calls into question the basic premise of these books3, doesn’t it?\\n\\n3\\n I personally love Good to Great anyway, because I think the ideas in there are timeless and excellent.\\nOops, did I just invalidate this entire website? \\nLately I’ve been wondering if a lot of business advice—both mine and others—is really a case of survivor bias. I mean, I didn’t start out at Smart Bear with a load of philosophy and a fixed idea of who the customer was or even what the products would be.\\nHow do I know this post-hoc philosophy and advice isn’t just a case of survivor bias? Am I not like the ESP-savant, successful not by force of nature but by simple chance of surviving?\\nOr perhaps I’m like Dr. Rhine the ESP experimenter—convinced I’ve discovered something important with “objective measures of success”—and yet I’m actually living in an egotistical, possibly even narcissistic dream world.\\nMore to the point, how can you, dear reader, ascertain whether my articles or any advice from anywhere suffers from this fallacy?\\nIn the end of course you don’t know. But here’s something: Just the fact that you’re aware of survivor bias means you’re less likely to be taken in by it. So, reading this article has helped a little.\\nBeyond that, prefer advice that makes you think rather than giving you answers, forces you to answer tough questions, and causes you to extend your existing strengths, and become a better version of the person you already are.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/survivor-bias/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBusiness Advice Plagued by Survivor Bias\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Bullet holes: A brain teaserBurying the other evidenceExperimental proof of ESPSpecific examples of survivor bias in business adviceOops, did I just invalidate this entire website?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

I did too. When you understand the cause, you can defeat it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I feel like a fraud. I’ve been at this for 16 years and I still feel like a fraud. I’m just waiting for the day they see through the façade, but they keep coming back every year.”  —Jason Young\\n\\nAh yes, the awe-inspiring words of confidence from the seasoned entrepreneur. My friend Jason intended this as soothing words of solace during (one of my) periods of personal freak-out while Smart Bear was in its infancy.\\nI felt like a fraud every day. Here I was, selling a wobbly, buggy tool and pawning myself off as an expert in a field that didn’t exist1. Every second I felt like I was putting one over on the world.\\n\\n1\\n Our software was the first commercial tool for peer code review. Now a standard practice for many developers, and a standard feature in many development tools, at the time we were creating a market that didn’t exist.\\nI would explain how our tool “cuts code review time in half,” but was that actually true or had I just repeated the argument so many times that I stopped questioning it? I would orchestrate purchases, but should I be handling large sums of money with no knowledge of accounting, cash-flow, invoicing, purchase orders, all while being relentlessly belittled by Accounts Payable? I would instruct customers on “best practices” for code review, even publishing a whole book about it, but who am I to tell other people how to critique code?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAren’t I too young? Isn’t the tool too crappy to charge for? Aren’t I too inexperienced? Don’t I need an MBA or at least some sales training?\\nIs Smart Bear a “real company?” What does that even mean?\\nObjectively, and with hindsight, my feelings were misplaced. The tool really did save time and headache; customers said so. As much as I doubted the title “Code Review Expert,” I had developed more experience with more teams in more situations than any one person could (because everyone else was busy doing their actual jobs). And sales isn’t as mystical and unknowable as I feared.\\nStill, emotions don’t respond to logic. Jason was telling me that these feelings don’t go away, even when they ought.\\nThe other thing he was saying is: You’re not alone. It’s not just business founders. Mike Meyers said “I still believe that at any time the No-Talent Police will come and arrest me.” Jodie Foster said “I thought it [winning the Oscar] was a fluke. The same way as when I walked on the campus at Yale. I thought everybody would find out, and they’d take the Oscar back.” June Huh, who dropped out of high-school to become a poet, and later won the Fields Medal—mathematics’ highest honor—says “Of course you are happy, but deep down, you’re a little bit worried that they might eventually figure out that you’re not actually that good. I am a reasonably good mathematician, but am I Fields Medal-worthy?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe name for this is Impostor Syndrome. Studies show that “40% of successful people consider themselves frauds” and that “A staggering 84% of the entrepreneurs and small business owners surveyed had scores indicating they feel like an imposter at moderate, frequent, or intense levels.” Ask any small business coach; they’ll confirm how prevalent these feelings are. It’s also common with PhD candidates. People constantly complain of it on Twitter, and that’s just the <1% who are (a) on Twitter and (b) willing to admit it.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nAlthough not an official psychological disorder, and generally not crippling, if you have these feelings it’s useful to know that it’s common and there’s something you can do about it.\\nSee if these sound familiar:\\n\\nYou dismiss compliments, awards, and positive reinforcement as “no big deal.”\\nYou are crushed by mild, constructive criticism.\\nYou believe you’re not as smart/talented/capable as other people think you are.\\nYou worry others will discover you’re not as smart/talented/capable as they think you are.\\nYou think other people with similar jobs are more “adult” than you are, and they “have their shit together” while you flounder around.\\nYou feel your successes are due more to luck than ability; with your failures it’s the other way around.\\nYou find it difficult to take credit for your accomplishments.\\nYou feel that you’re the living embodiment of “fake it until you make it.”\\n\\nBut wait, how can this be? This overwhelming lack of self-confidence is the opposite of the traditional entrepreneurial stereotype. Don’t founders forge ahead even when others say success is impossible? Doesn’t a founder invent a new product based on her confidence that others will want it? Doesn’t the very idea of starting your own company scream “I’m doing it my way, and my way is better?”\\nHere’s why it makes sense. Consider what it means to be a perfectionist. The perfectionist sees flaws in everyone else’s work; there’s always a way to make it better—her way. She doesn’t respond well to authority dictating how things must be; neither is she comfortable delegating to those who (by her definition) clearly don’t care as much as she does.\\nSounds like the stereotypical attitude of the arrogant startup founder, but wait! At the same time, the perfectionist is never happy with her own work either, seeing (inventing?) a never-ending stream of flaws that require attention. No matter how highly others regard her work, the perfectionist insists it’s incomplete and unsatisfactory. She can’t accept the idea that others would be impressed with her accomplishments, because to her eyes they’re mediocre works-in-progress. She worries that one day they’ll realize she’s right.\\nOur entrepreneurial motivation is not confidence, it’s an insatiable desire to do it our way. Doing it our own way is not the same as being confident that it is the correct way. It’s about never accepting any idea as being best, even if you like your current ideas better than everyone else’s.\\nCan these feelings be constructive? Yes, if they’re a sign that you’re striving to learn and improve. As Andy Wibbels says:\\n\\nIf I don’t feel like a fraud at least once a day then I’m not reaching far enough.\\nIf you aren’t scared shitless then why bother?\\n\\nHere’s what it looks like when you’re channeling these self-doubts into something constructive:\\n\\nI doubt my title as “expert,” so every day I read, write, and immerse myself in my field.\\nI doubt the quality of my software, so I fix bugs as fast as possible, I write unit tests proactively, and I thank my customers for their patience.\\nI doubt I deserve my reputation, so I work hard to earn it.\\nI’m not as good as I want to be at speaking/writing/programming/designing/managing, but I can see myself slowly improving.\\nI’m not a “real company” yet, so I concentrate on making my customers successful, so they don’t care about corporate size or structure.\\n\\nOn the other hand, here’s what it looks like when these doubts are harming you:\\n\\nI doubt my title as “expert,” so every night I worry about what will happen when I’m discovered as a fraud. I’m absent-mindedly looking for trivially-easy jobs I could take where this pressure won’t exist. (Looking for an “escape-hatch” is a well-documented behavior.)\\nI doubt the quality of my software, so I spend lots of time covering it up with graphic design and heavy sales pitches.\\nI doubt I deserve my reputation, so I live in constant fear of exposure. I can’t sleep at night and I loathe myself for lying.\\nI’m not as good as I want to be at speaking/writing/programming/designing/managing, so I go out of my way to avoid any of it, and feel like a trapped animal when I’m forced to do it.\\nI’m not a “real company” yet, so I feel guilty every time someone gives me money or believes anything I say.\\n\\nIf you’re letting these feelings get to you too, at least recognize it so you can deal with it logically.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s some specific ways to answer the Impostor voice in your head: \\n\\n…yet\\nWhatever it is you think you’re not good enough for, append the word “yet.” I can’t do this job… yet. This article isn’t good enough… yet. I don’t deserve the title I have… yet.\\n“Am I a curious student?2”\\nA: When you meet a student, who is honesty, energetically, and humbly pursuing learning and growth, do you think “That’s awesome, good for them, how can I help,” or do you think “They’re an impostor for not already being an expert?” So, when you act as a curious student, that’s not being an impostor, that’s the state of being a student. Which is awesome.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Inspired by Mihir Patel’s article\\n\\n“Do I deserve to be peers with my peers?”\\nA: Yes, unless you think Neil Gaiman doesn’t deserve to be at the same party as Neil Armstrong or vice versa, because they feel the same way, and you know they’re both wrong.\\n“Do I deserve the [title/position/responsibility] I have?”\\nA: Do you think some idiot gave you a hand-out for nothing? If not, then yes, you deserve it.\\n“Sometimes I feel stretched and that I don’t know what I’m doing.”\\nA: That is the human condition, for humans who strive. Only someone who is ignorant and foolhardy doesn’t realize there’s more to know, more to learn, and to be careful with confidence. If Mike Meyers isn’t sure whether he’s funny, then it’s just the human condition. Even if sometimes you are stretched too far, that’s the normal condition for striving. It’s something to embrace and work on, not evidence that you shouldn’t be doing it at all. Unless you think “learning and growing” is something you should never do, or if you think “learning and growing” should never feel uncomfortable.\\n\\nAnd when logic fails, maybe this will help: \\nYou believe that Mike Meyers and Jodie Foster are talented, right? And June huh deserves that medal? You might even believe that I’m an expert in peer code review and startups in general. Yet we doubt ourselves every day. And we’re wrong.\\nSo if we’re wrong, you’re wrong too.\\nDon’t stop striving, just stop holding yourself to an impossible standard, and don’t worry what other people think.\\nThey’re not thinking about you at all.\\n\\nMany thanks to Matt Cohen and Scott W.

Gorgeous. I asked everyone I met there about it and no one but the receptionist had ever seen it. It’s sitting in the lobby. The receptionist, by the way, knew exactly what their branch of Adobe (Ottawa) did and could articulate why people bought their products in about 15 seconds. Her elevator pitch was better than the 10 minute diatribe I got from a senior manager later that day.)\\n\\nI made one of those bold because that’s the one that’s always stuck with me. We got the sign about a year ago, and it really was a proud moment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently Smart Bear has everything but the glossy book (but we do have a book with a glossy cover with over 7000 copies in circulation). The 8000’th user of our various software products just came on-line. That makes me feel like a real company. \\xa0[2009 Update: now 45,000 books and 30,000 paying users]\\n\\nThat was written 16 years ago. Now in 2023, I have a new story.\\nI needed a new one… it’s not hard to pay employees anymore, and you’ve probably never heard of VistaPrint, nor used Quicken. Well, it used to be funny:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was a little boy growing up in Austin Texas, “Downtown” was this frightening place we never went to. Downtown had full of things like government buildings and law firms and things that families didn’t go to, and there was crime1.\\n\\n1\\n Austin was 1/10th its current size, and probably didn’t have that much crime, but to a little-boy brain, it was scary.\\nBut often we would come to the outskirts of Downtown to get bagels. My parents grew up in and around New York City, and they insisted there was only one place to get “real” bagels. So sometimes, on the weekend, we’d get in the station wagon, I would hop in my car seat, and we’d go down to the bagel store on the edge of Downtown. Looking out window, I knew we were at the bagel store when I could see a long, sloping ramp that led a parking garage. I would wait in the car, staring at that scary office building across the street, they’d get the bagels, and then we’d immediately U-turn and get out of there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast forward 40 years, and I’m standing in a public park with our amazing CEO Heather Brunner and a few dozen of the many hundreds of people who worked at WP Engine, watching as our sign goes up on the building. We kept checking a picture of the company logo on our cell phones, ensuring that each little piece was correctly oriented. (We couldn’t remember ourselves!)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat building, is the building with the sloping ramp, imprinted on my memory like a duckling on its mother, one of those inexplicable snatches of childhood memories.\\nYou’re a real company when…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/real-company/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou’re a real company when…\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

It cannot be “figured out later,” because it determines your business model today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s often said that you shouldn’t talk about price during customer development interviews. The usual justification is that your goal is to uncover the details of your potential customers’ lives and pain-points, whereas mentioning price diverts the discussion to budgets and operational things far removed from the customers’ day-to-day life.\\nBut I disagree. Price is as important as any other feature to determine product/market “fit.”\\nHow many times have you heard someone agree that “it would be great if someone did X,” but when you show them a demo of X, but it costs $700, and they don’t buy? Or seen a review of an iPhone app hung up on pricing trivialities: “It would be pretty good at $0.99, but it’s not worth $1.99.” How many times have you seen someone struggle with an inferior product because they cannot afford the better one? Or struggle with the freemium version because they refuse to pay anything at all, even though they like and use the product? Or struggle with an inferior, expensive product that was purchased based on the salesmanship—“expensive must mean it’s better”—instead of craftsmanship?\\nPrice is inextricably linked to brand, product, and purchasing decisions—by whom, why, how, and when. Price is not an exercise in maximizing some micro-economic supply/demand curve, slapped post facto onto the product. Rather, it fundamentally determines the nature of the product and the structure of the business that produces it.\\nConsider the consequences of each order-of-magnitude of pricing:\\n$0/mo means your goal is to maximize growth (trust and usage) instead of revenue. Your product is designed with natural tripwires to trigger other pricing (Freemium model), or not (business model left as an exercise to your future self). Typically requires venture funding because you have no income, and if you’re successful you’ll need lots of people and tech to run the business. Even super-efficient outliers like WhatsApp (sold for $19B with 55 employees) and Instagram (sold for $1B with 13 employees) each raised tens of millions of dollars in venture funding. This is often B2C because the value is in quantity of customers, and there are 100x more consumers than businesses.\\n$1/mo means you can’t afford customer service and it must incrementally free to run the technology behind it, both of which have implications for the sort of product you have to build (e.g. simple enough to be self-service). Marketing and sales spend is nil (at least initially), so there has to be a reason it spreads by word of mouth, ideally virally as a natural result of using the product itself, or through vocally passionate early users, perhaps galvanized around a mission.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$10/mo means people see you as a cheap version of something else, but still expect a phone number. (Think: GoDaddy). Bootstrapped businesses can make this work (e.g. most shared hosting companies), but they only make interesting money at large scale (by definition, because it takes over 8000 customers to make only $1m/yr in revenue), which takes a long time to grow. So you can get to $10s of millions but it will take 10 years. (Again, like shared hosting companies.) This is a hard slog. If you want to scale faster you’ll need venture funding, both because of the anemic revenue, and because otherwise you can’t afford to advertise. Often bootstrapped companies of this type boast about having no marketing or sales departments, but the truth is they can’t afford it, and those companies typically grow slowly, often eclipsed by companies who can afford to grow 10x faster. In a huge market this is probably still OK because there’s enough customers for everyone to thrive in different ways. On the good side for this business model, often people will simply forget they have the $10/mo service even if they don’t use it, resulting in “free revenue” which at scale can be surprisingly substantial (yet again like shared hosting companies).\\n$100/mo means people expect to be able to call support, and if a competitor is substantially better, it’s probably worth the effort to switch. Also this is almost exclusively B2B unless it’s something “luxury.” Big companies can buy it without much consideration, but small companies need to understand the value, so you might need sales material to convince them, and a demo. I love this price zone for bootstrapped companies, because it’s low enough that you can address a broad business market, but high enough that you can get nicely profitable with a reasonable, achievable number of customers (e.g. 200-300), and you can afford to spend money acquiring them.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n$1,000/mo means only medium to large companies can afford it. They’ll have buying processes around annual budgets, approvals, ROIs, demos. You will be compared to alternatives and weighed. You need to be a part of that conversation which means a real sales force, sales materials, impressive logos, case studies, and referenceable customers. Features might need to include things that big companies need that others don’t, like role-based access privileges and integration with LDAP. This can be a surprisingly difficult zone to become profitable in, because the sales and marketing motions and engineering costs are the same as for much larger sales, but without the attendant revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$10,000/mo means larger companies only. It’s unlikely the product is sufficient out-of-the-box, so you might need in-house professional services or to partner with consulting firms for implementation—constructing the “Whole Product” in the language of Geoffrey Moore. If something goes wrong they’ll cancel and not be willing to pay out the rest (no matter what your contract says; what are you going to do, sue your customers?). It’s possible to achieve this price-point with mid-sized companies if it’s usage-based (e.g. ZenDesk, JIRA, Box, Slack) or performance-based (e.g. marketing optimization), so the product itself needs to create and then demonstrate value to earn that result.\\n$100,000/mo means Global 2000 only, large-scale projects that require multiple departments for decision and approval, long sales cycles (9-18 months) which requires massive cash outlay as you bide your time. Likely starts as a pilot or proof-of-concept, which hopefully you can get paid for, and which needs to be convincingly successful, perhaps battling against another pilot with another vendor. You’ll need on-site visits even in this day and age of video-conferencing. Examples: WorkDay (much of revenue is consulting), IBM.\\nSo which is better—higher or lower or in the middle? That’s a better question. Here’s something resembling an answer.\\nThe main thing is to understand that price is linked to everything, and bring it into your customer interview process. Talk about their expectations of cost, and why, who would write the check, who would need to approve it, whether an ROI argument would be welcomed or scoffed at, or what would need to be changed (if anything?) to justify doubling your price (at which point, maybe you should do that an in fact double your price).\\nPrice is not an afterthought, it is essential business design.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/pricing-determines-your-business-model/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPricing determines your business model\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Being “in command” is ideal: honest, introspective, agile, aware, and proactive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a founder or CEO or team leader is “in command” of her business, I don’t worry about that business, regardless of its challenges.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you always meet your own expectations for yourself or your team. It means you have expectations of yourself and your team, and when you don’t meet them, it bothers you, and you react.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean the metrics are always healthy, nor even that they’re moving in the right direction. It means you’ve already thought about what to measure and you’re watching the things that really matter. When metrics go awry, you’re the first one to identify that, and are already taking action in proportion to their importance and how far off the mark they are.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean the product has no bugs. It means you have a list of 100-1000 bugs, and the reason you’re not working on them is that you’re working on the top three that matter most.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you’re always the smartest person in the room. It means you’ve hired a team of great people who can challenge you and bring diverse perspectives to the table.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you never make mistakes. It means you’re proactively on the look-out for mistakes, and call them out when you find them, so that now you can rally many people in finding solutions, and make a change.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you never feel overwhelmed. It means you recognize when you’re overwhelmed, take steps to manage your stress, and seek support when needed.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean there are no problems with any team member. It means you’ve already talked to that person about it, and you’re working with them to change. Whether that means changing and staying, or changing by leaving. It means you’re proactively and intentionally solving for fulfillment for the whole team, which includes yourself.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean there are no existential threats looming over the business. It means you’ve articulated what those are because you sought them out and faced them head-on, and you’re mitigating the more likely ones with a few, logical actions.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean customers aren’t leaving due to lack of features. It means you’ve identified what those features are, which ones are consistent with your strategy, which ones lead to the ultimate benefits the customer is seeking, and that you’re working on one or two of them right now.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you’re always popular. It means you’re willing to make tough decisions, even if they’re not always well-received, because they’re in the best interest of the customer, the team, and the business.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you’re constantly telling people what to do. It means you’re acting as an editor, not a writer, unless being a writer is necessary to make progress. And if that is happening constantly, that you make a change on the team so that it’s not happening constantly. That might mean changing someone else, or changing yourself1.\\n\\n1\\n If you’re constantly having to do someone else’s work, that’s your fault. Either you’ve hired incorrectly, which is your fault, or you have hired correctly and you’re not allowing them to do their job, which is your fault.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean your strategy is completely correct. It means you are adhering to the characteristics of great strategy. You have one, that is written down, that a normal person can understand, that people genuinely try to follow. When strategic flaws become apparent, you write those down too, and work on one or two at a time, updating your strategy calmly but purposefully.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean surprises never occur. It means when they do occur, it’s not due to negligence. It means something actually changed, or an important new fact was uncovered. Even better, if you were intentionally seeking new information, and thus seeking surprise.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you win every sale. It means you seek to understand the patterns in the wins and losses, and when those intersect with something consistent with your strengths and strategy and thus where you should win, you make changes so you can win the next such deal.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean every A/B test is a success. It means you’re running A/B tests and honestly assessing the results, so that you improve over time.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you don’t have a long backlog, most of which you’ll never get to. It means you’ve identified the few Rocks that are your bets on how to win strategically, and you have a system for prioritizing the rest, which also means doing almost none of the rest.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you know everything about your target customer. It means you are actively seeking out what they say and do, so you can understand them better, so you can make better decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell when events change, I change my mind. What do you do?\\n—Paul Samuelson, winner of 1970 Nobel Prize in Economics, about how his models of inflation during WWII kept changing over time, and he was criticized for “not being able to make up his mind.”\\n\\n\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you never change your mind. Indeed, a mind that never changes, is very likely wrong. It means you wrote down what you think, so that it’s more obvious when your mind needs to change, and then you communicate that change—both what and why. Even if just to yourself.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you do everything that stakeholders or even executives ask you to do. It means you listened with curiosity and empathy to what has been asked, having a system to reject bad requests and prioritize good requests, communicating that result and the rationale behind it.\\nBeing “in command” doesn’t mean you’re “in control” of everyone and everything. It means you’re proactively seeking the truth, working rationally, and communicating.\\nThis is how you create autonomy, coupled with accountability, with realistic expectations.\\nStrive to be “in command.”\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/in-command/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn command\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Say “no” to anything that distracts from your goal, your vision, your strategy, tempting though it is to explore all opportunities, hoping each time that this is the one that will catapult you to “success” (whatever that is).\\nLack of focus results in half-assed initiatives, each interrupted by apparently greener pastures before you’ve invested the time and devotion it deserves. Learn to say “no!”\\nAh, but then again you must also experiment with new ideas. Fail fast! Pivot! Test! Doubt! Always be collecting evidence that you’re wrong, always be trying new things in case you’ve been blind. Never pass up an opportunity to change, learn, grow.\\nSo… how are you supposed to explore other ideas if you’re also supposed to be saying “no” to anything that diverges from The Plan?\\nHere’s what I do: I never say “no.” But I carefully qualify “yes.”\\nI learned this trick in high school. In the mid ’90s it was clear that Apple had lost the personal computer battle and all their developers were fleeing like rats off a sinking ship into the ocean of opportunity that was Windows 95. As a maven of the Macintosh API and still willing to admit it, I landed small contracting jobs fixing up code that other developers wouldn’t touch.\\nMy typical rate was $25 per hour, which feels like a lot of money when you’re 17 in the ’90s.\\nOne day I got a call from some poor schleps I didn’t want to help. They had just completed a new product written in Java and it was broken on a Mac, and could I help? None of their customers used Macs, so they didn’t think Macs were important, but then it turns out the main investor is keen on seeing the demo on a Mac, and when they tried it, it didn’t work. (Yay investors! Yay supposedly-cross-platform-platforms-that-aren’t-really!)\\nI wanted no part of this. Java was brand new and known to be full of bugs, and anyway I was a C/C++ kind of guy, and I didn’t want to get involved in an academic fad language like Java1.\\n\\n1\\n So yeah, I simultaneously decided that (1) Java is a fad and (2) I’m sticking with the Macintosh Toolkit; five years later one those platforms had zero developers and the other had one million, and I picked exactly wrong. Predicting the future is hard.\\nI could have said “no.” Given my specialty and my goals, traditional career (or startup) theory says I should have said “no.”\\nBut instead, on the advice of an older, wiser friend, I showed up at their office and said I’d do it for $100 per hour.\\nI fully expected them to laugh in my face. Maybe I would receive a condescending talking-to about the audacity—nay, the impudence!— of someone of my tender age and meager experience walking in here and demanding such outrageous compensation, someone who, let’s be clear, is technically too young to even enter into a legal consulting agreement in the first place.\\nAnd then I would have slinked out of there, embarrassed but ultimately no worse for wear.\\nBut that’s not what happened. They looked me up and down, their faces painted with both incredulity and surrender. They said OK.\\xa0An hour and a half later, everything was working. The difference between saying “no” and getting $150 for about two hours of my life was all in how I phrased “yes.”\\nAnd I have stories that went the other way, which are just as important.\\nAt WP Engine, for example, we’re constantly talking to large bloggers who want to move to our system. These are folks with big requirements—tens of millions of monthly page-views, traffic spikes, custom code, perfect up-time, and 24/7 support.\\nShould we take on those clients? Maybe not—after all the stated goal of WP Engine is to serve the “middle market”—the folks who have outgrown free blogs, don’t like maintaining their own servers, but aren’t so large that they have extreme hosting demands. That’s our profitable niche2.\\n\\n2\\n Editor’s note: This was written about 1 year into WP Engine’s life; in 2023 WP Engine is 13 years old with 200,000 customers, and powers more large WordPress sites than anyone on Earth. This was a great segment to start off with, but we evolved as we scaled.\\nOr so we think. But if we just say “no” to these big bloggers, maybe we’re closing the door on big, important orders. Perhaps the entire company should pivot—maybe it’s easier or more profitable to serve 100 large blogs than 1000 medium ones. But how do we know if we say “no?”\\nThen again, if we say “yes” we might really be screwed. If we can’t provide them the human and technical service they expect, now we’ve hurt a blogger, we get bad press, and we’ve wasted a bunch of time.\\xa0Or even worse, we hold on for dear life but it’s extremely unprofitable, and now we have this expensive, time-consuming albatross around our necks.\\nSo we’ve said “yes” by quoting high enough that we know for certain we will make good money on the deal, so much so that it will partially fund something else we want to do. Maybe that means a big new advertising campaign, or hiring another WordPress expert for our staff.\\nThere was one especially large customer where we literally thought of it like this: This deal needs to be big enough to not only make a reasonable profit on the operating expenses, but pay for an entire developer’s salary (assuming bootstrapped, put-in-elbow-grease-for-stock low salary), because we know this new customer will occupy a lot of that person’s time, but all the remaining time we get “for free.”\\nSo we’ve given a lot of qualified yeses, and many were rejected. (P.S. Now we’re able to say “yes” to those same bloggers, but that’s because over time we’ve taken on bigger and bigger customers, and now a blogger with 30 million month page-views is something we know we can handle.)\\nAt Smart Bear I used this principle yet again. Companies would fly me out to help them implement a peer code review process, which half the time actually meant that “management” wanted me to convince everyone else that code review was a good idea, and invent a process painless enough that they might actually do it.\\nFrom a business perspective, this was a poor use of my time. These folks had already bought our software, so it didn’t sell more seats. When you counted a travel day on either side of the engagement, the time I lost could have been spent landing just one additional customer or make some important changes to the code, either of which almost certainly makes us more money.\\nTherefore, initially I just said “no.” But again that’s wrong. Eventually I said “yes,” but the price was $2500/day including travel days, which for these sorts of engagements is unheard of. (Typically you get reimbursed for travel expenses but not paid for that time.)\\nThis immediately cut out most trips, but some remained. On those trips I’d haul in $10,000 for a week of easy work, which I’d often combine with a long weekend with my wife. And anyway those people really wanted me there, which made the work that much more enjoyable.\\nSo the principle is straightforward: Set the conditions of “yes” such that:\\n\\nIf they say “yes,” you’re happy because the terms or money are so good, it more than compensates for the distraction, perhaps funding the thing you really want to do.\\nIf they say “no,” you’re happy because it wasn’t a great fit anyway; it’s not a worthwhile return on your time and effort.\\n\\nSo that’s the punch-line, but before you leave I’d like to over-emphasize the idea of “funding the thing you really want to do.”\\nThis can take many forms, but it’s the single best way of figuring out how to qualify your “yes.” Examples:\\n\\n“Yes” if it pays for an entire additional person.\\n“Yes” if this extends the runway of our startup by at least three months.\\n“Yes” if it completely funds development we’d like to do anyway.\\n“Yes” if it means one of the co-founders can quit her day-job.\\n“Yes” if it will completely pay for three new marketing efforts.\\n\\nThink of it like another form of funding. Funding is always a distraction from actually running your business, so the amount of money you get must be transformative to the business. Each of those bullet points are transformative, in that each has the potential to move your company from “hobby” to “real business.”\\nAnd if they say “no,” you’re fine with that, because it would have been a distraction which wouldn’t have moved the needle.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/say-yes/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNever say “no,” but rarely say “yes.”\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

I haven’t talked about it at all on this blog, and it’s time1 I spill my guts about the whole affair.\\n\\n1\\n This article was written in 2009.\\nYou’d think selling a company would be a glamorous, exuberant experience, but I was surprised at the reactions I got. These are actual quotes:\\n\\n“How could you sell your baby? I’m shocked.”\\n“I thought you said things were going well. Hmm.”\\n“You’re such a sell-out! You used to be one of the few cool people I knew.”\\n\\nInterestingly, 100% of the negative reactions were from people who had never started their own company. But that doesn’t make them wrong, and it doesn’t make their words sting less, especially when they’re your friends.\\nNow that almost two years have passed, I can relate exactly why “selling my baby” was right for me.\\nHopefully this thought process is interesting to you and possibly useful in the happy event that you’re faced with the same choice, but the truth is I just need to get this off my chest.\\nI need to explain to those who still consider me a sell-out.\\nYou may have heard Noam Wasserman’s “Rich or King” choice: Company founders are either in it for the money (“Rich”) or in it to build a lifestyle and personal identity (“King”). FogCreek and 37signals are built to be “King;” all venture-funded companies are built to be “Rich.”\\nNoam says that successful founders make the “Rich or King” decision up front, and that though it doesn’t matter which path you take, you must be consistent in your actions. You can’t mix “be king” tactics with “get rich” end goals.\\nExcept I did mix “Rich” and “King,” and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee, it’s good to be “King,” but what do you do when you’re at Trudy’s “North Star” Tex-Mex Restaurant tucking into a Chile Relleno (with salsa verde, black beans, and the ground beef filling), and the guy across the table looks you in the eye and offers you enough money that you never have to work again?\\nI was always in it for the money, especially in the form of acquisition. Everyone who came to work at Smart Bear was indoctrinated with this attitude in no uncertain terms; even before hiring someone, I would tell them that we’re here to make money, and if someone offers to buy the company someday, I’m going to sell it, and all of us will make money.\\nProfit was the rule behind every choice we made. Although the end goal was always acquisition, my attitude was (and still is) that the best way to get yourself acquired is to be profitable2. Profits prove the business is operating well. Profits validate the market. Profits make minimum valuation easy. Profits mean the buyer converts balance-sheet money into bottom-line profit-and-loss money—a trade every large company wants to make.\\n\\n2\\n Editor’s Note: At this time the blog was written exclusively for bootstrappers with small companies. Obviously there are many examples of companies sold on the basis of growth or “daily active users,” but small self-funded companies are most attractive when they are cash machines.\\nMost of all, profits mean you don’t need to sell, which gives you the ability to walk away from a deal. You have little negotiating power in any deal unless you can happily walk away.\\nOn the other hand, I knew I would only be happy building a genuine, great company, where the product solves a real pain, where customers are given white-glove service, where “tech support” is the only sales force, where we leave the world a little better than we found it, and where every employee is smart and gets things done and is trusted with any decision.\\nAnd I wanted the ego-inflating trappings of running a company. It’s cool at parties to say “I run my own company.” I wrote a book that got so popular (in my little corner of the world) that people would bring it up to me to sign. (We gave the books away for free so the joke was that by signing I doubled its value.) When I walked onto a tradeshow floor it was like Norm on Cheers—I knew everyone and they knew me. I got to present at cool venues like the Business of Software Conference.\\nAnd I write this blog, shamelessly exploiting Smart Bear’s success to convince you that I’m worth reading.\\nIn short, although the goal was “Rich,” I achieved it by behaving like the goal was “King.” I don’t know why people find this contradictory; after all, acting like “King” means building a long-term, sustainable business, and that’s exactly the kind of business that gets acquired.\\nStill, because “King” was enjoyable and Smart Bear was profitable, I still need to explain why becoming a “sell-out” was the right choice.\\nThe first thing to understand is the non-linear relationship between “cash in personal savings” and “financial freedom”:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a line you cross where your savings alone will fund a reasonably lavish lifestyle. At the risk of sounding like George Bush, this is a Freedom Line—freedom from restrictions about what you can do with your life, family, and career.\\nMy observations:\\n\\nA movement from left of the line to right of the line changes your life fundamentally, giving you the freedom to do whatever makes you happy, forever.\\nIf you’re crossing from left to right, it doesn’t matter how far to the right you go. (Sure, $100m is a different lifestyle than $10m, but it’s not as critical to lifestyle or happiness as just crossing the line.)\\n\\n(1) is what was offered to me at Trudy’s Tex-Mex. (2) means it almost didn’t matter what the offer was, so long as it was big enough.\\nSome people gave me a hard time about (2). The typical argument was:\\n\\nYour company is growing 100% year over year. It’s profitable and throwing off cash. Why not wait another year and let revenues double again, which will make the company six times more valuable (assuming 3x revenue valuation, a reasonable ballpark for a growing software company3).\\n\\n\\n3\\n Editor’s Note: This was written in 2009; In 2023, a 5x-10x multiple on this type of company at that growth rate and profit is reasonable.\\nHere’s the best analogy I’ve come up with to describe why this is flawed logic. It’s called the Box Game:\\nImagine I have two opaque boxes. Box A contains $10. Box B has a 50% chance of containing $20, and a 50% chance of containing nothing at all. You pick either box and take whatever’s inside. Which box do you pick?\\nOf course statistically there’s no difference, so this isn’t a question of math or economics or intelligence; it’s a measure of your attitude towards risk.\\nMost people pick box B. After all, the difference between $10 and $20 is trivial and it’s more fun and exciting to pick B.\\nBut what if the numbers were different?\\nNow box A holds $10,000,000. Box B either holds $20,000,000 or nothing, 50/50 chance. Which do you pick?\\nYou pick box A. Of course! Because it moves you from the left of the Freedom Line to the right. And because a “chance of moving even further” isn’t worth giving up the certainty of that life-altering event.\\nThis is my argument in favor of #2 and against “wait and see.” This is why I sold.\\nIn my case, the correctness of my choice was made painfully clear by the economic crash in 2008. Had I held out for “another year and far more money”—box B—I would have found an empty box.\\nI know this for a fact—another company (can’t say who, sorry!) was offered a deal at the same time I was. This founder wanted to roll the dice (box B) and delayed the buyer. Two quarters passed and revenue failed to grow; the buyer nixed the deal. Months later with the recession in sight, the founder approached the buyer again, this time willing to accept a low offer. The buyer refused; that ship had sailed.\\nThere are those for whom this calculus doesn’t apply because they want to be “King” no matter what. I’ll bet Jason Fried wouldn’t sell 37signals for $100,000,000; neither would Joel Spolsky sell FogCreek. Are Joel and Jason being irrational? Of course not. But neither was I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs of December 2007, I have the freedom to work on any project I want for the rest of my life while simultaneously providing for my family, never again worrying about bills, debt, having a place to sleep, or sending our daughter to any college she wants.\\nI can stay home with my wife and new baby girl for as long as I want, having all the precious time and experiences and memories that they say money can’t buy.\\nBut, in the sense of securing that freedom, it can.\\nAnd by crossing the line, I did.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/rich-vs-king-sold-company/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRich vs. King in the Real World: Why I sold my company\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

(P would generate revenue, but Q would reduce cancellations, but R would save us money)\\nWhich candidate should we hire?  (P has the best skills, but Q has more experience in our market, but R seems like the best culture-fit)\\nWhich new marketing campaign should we spend thousands of dollars to test?  (P is cheaper to try, but Q has a larger reach, but R is targeted at our industry)\\n\\nNot only do you need the best decision, you also need to be able to explain your decision to others, especially to those who wish the decision had gone a different way. Do not under-value the importance of crisp explanation.\\nThe “rubric” is the typical framework for these decisions; a separate paper on this site explains how to use one effectively for “ROI-style” decisions1. Unfortunately, while it may feel productive to fill many cells with many numbers, and while it may feel analytically rigorous to convolute those numbers into a final score, this fails to clearly identify the best choice, and fails to create a clear explanation for the choice.\\n\\n1\\n The goal of ROI is to maximize efficiency, i.e. deliver the most amount of value per unit of time. This paper asks a different question: How to decide the single most valuable thing, regardless of cost, with incommensurate and conflicting dimensions\\nAfter demonstrating and analyzing the causes of this failure, I present an alternative framework I’ve nick-named “Binstack2.”\\n\\n2\\n Additional resource: Adam Waselnuk created a Notion Process Template for Binstack.\\nWhy rubrics don’t add up \\nConsider two players in a game, with attributes:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttribute\\nPlayer P\\nPlayer Q\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth\\n8\\n5\\n\\n\\nStrength\\n5\\n7\\n\\n\\nSpeed\\n2\\n6\\n\\n\\nEndurance\\n5\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich player is better? If one scored higher than the other in every dimension, the choice would be simple. In this case, each player is better than the other along two dimensions, and worse along two; objectively there’s no clear winner.\\nSo let’s try a rubric. In its simplest form, we add up the scores contributed by each dimension, and the total score decides the winner. Unfortunately, this doesn’t tell us which one is better:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttribute\\nPlayer P\\nPlayer Q\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth\\n8\\n5\\n\\n\\nStrength\\n5\\n7\\n\\n\\nSpeed\\n2\\n6\\n\\n\\nEndurance\\n5\\n2\\n\\n\\nTotal:\\n20\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGames often engineer this result on purpose, to create players that are different but not over-powered. This creates a balanced game, but to make a confident decision about which one is “best,” we need something imbalanced.\\nReal-life rubrics often result in a pile of options that share a similar score, resulting in no clear winner. Even if we make a decision, we can’t explain the decision to others, because in actual fact it’s a tie, and the tie was broken arbitrarily. That’s no way to make a decision.\\nTo create separation, people often add “weights” to the raw value to create a new kind of “score.” In this case, suppose that with our game-playing style we don’t care much about Speed, but we can really leverage Strength. So we assign weights which we multiply against the scores, to compute a customized metric of “value.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttribute\\nOrig P\\nOrig Q\\nWt\\nWted P\\nWted Q\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth\\n8\\n5\\n1.0\\n8\\n5\\n\\n\\nStrength\\n5\\n7\\n2.0\\n10\\n14\\n\\n\\nSpeed\\n2\\n6\\n0.5\\n1\\n3\\n\\n\\nEndurance\\n5\\n2\\n1.0\\n5\\n2\\n\\n\\nTotal:\\n20\\n20\\n\\n24\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, shoot. That didn’t help. What if we contrive to force Q to be better, by intentionally using weights that penalize the two attributes where P is superior?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttribute\\nOrig P\\nOrig Q\\nWt\\nWted P\\nWted Q\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth\\n8\\n5\\n0.5\\n4\\n2.5\\n\\n\\nStrength\\n5\\n7\\n2.0\\n10\\n14\\n\\n\\nSpeed\\n2\\n6\\n0.5\\n1\\n3\\n\\n\\nEndurance\\n5\\n2\\n0.5\\n2.5\\n1\\n\\n\\nTotal:\\n20\\n20\\n\\n17.5\\n20.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEven with a conspiracy to throw the election for Q, it wins by a mere 2.5 points out of 20—hardly a resounding victory that would give everyone confidence in the decision.\\nThis happens in the real world. Even with weights, a clear winner often does not emerge, and again we’re back to a weak, indefensible decision.\\nWorse: In the real world we rarely have precise scores. Attributes like “potential new revenue” and “increased customer satisfaction” are not predictable with accuracy. For more qualitative measures we use scales “from 1 to 5” which are even less precise. This imprecision creates inherent error, which is then compounded by multiplying weights. Differences in the final results might be more error than signal. How would you even know?\\nWorse again: The attributes aren’t comparable. Whatever units the game uses for “Health,” they’re not related to whatever units the game uses for “Speed.” By adding them together, we’re implicitly saying “these are comparable,” but they are not. Weights are supposed to solve this by converting everything into some sort of “value,” but if you say out loud what the weights are doing, it sounds incorrect. For example: “Every $150k of additional ARR is exactly as valuable to us as 10% more customer satisfaction. Indeed, we would be fine with customer satisfaction going down 10% if we added $300k in new ARR.” Really?\\nIt’s largely noise, which is why we’re unhappy with the so-called “winner.”\\nSolution: Binstack: Stack-ranked binary attributes \\nTo transcend the noise, stop pretending that the values in the rows are precise or comparable.\\nA general rule of complex decisions, is that often they’re difficult because we’ve avoided making other, smaller decisions. That is the case with the rubric, as we’re about to fix.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nOur top-level purpose is to pick the item that maximizes impact, and to be able to explain why. So, first we’re going to make smaller decisions about the true impact of each item, and then we’re going to make a decision about which impacts are most valuable.\\nBinary materiality \\nNo more values, no more weights, no more scores. Either an item materially contributes to that attribute, or it doesn’t. “Materially” means the effect is so large you can measure it easily:\\n\\nNot just “more revenue,” but at least a 10% bump so that the curve visibly changes.\\nNot just “more retention,” but a 20% decrease in cancellations tied to a specific cause.\\nNot just “more intuitive,” but a 40% decrease in support tickets on a certain topic.\\nNot just “more competitive,” but sales will add it to their standard presentation and marketing will add it to the feature-table on the pricing page.\\nNot just “more profitable,” but overall gross profit margin will improve by 1%.\\nNot just “will pay for it,” but putting it in a higher pricing tier or add-on will cause 5% of customers to upgrade.\\nNot just “better UX,” but a 50% increase the success-rate for people moving through the interface.\\nNot just “widely used,” but 40% of customers surveyed scored at least 4 out of 5 on whether they’d use the feature.\\nNot just “customer satisfaction,” but moving from a 4/10 to a 8/10 on a survey related to this area of the product.\\nNot just “thought leadership,” but marketing commits to getting ten external articles to reference it in the next quarter.\\n\\nForce people to write down exactly what the material change is expected to be. Not because the estimates are accurate, but because it forces the person to think through the answer. Most ideas, we’ll eventually admit, are so incremental that we won’t be able to measure the effect; that means it is “not material.” That’s a tough fact to face, but remember the point of the exercise is to force exactly these conclusions, to drastically reduce the field of ideas so that only the actually-best ideas remain. These smaller decisions will make the larger decision easy.\\nBecause this “material change” is just a guess, we won’t put it in an equation—no computing with noise! But if you can’t justify a magnitude greater than “business as usual,” the idea is simply not impactful enough. Your standards are higher than that.\\nIn our example, if we simplistically considered any score that is “6 or greater” to be “material,” we’d already have a winner:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttribute\\nPlayer P\\nPlayer Q\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth\\n✓\\n\\n\\n\\nStrength\\n\\n✓\\n\\n\\nSpeed\\n\\n✓\\n\\n\\nEndurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal:\\n1\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach “point” in this method is meaningful, so even a difference of 1 point crowns a clear winner. With real-world attributes, and a sufficiently high bar, you will reject nearly all items quickly. People won’t like that—their favorite thing will be cut—but it’s the only way to stop wasting your time dithering between a pile of things that won’t make a difference.\\nIt’s also extremely easy to explain your decision: Q materially impacts two important things; everything else is less impactful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is, of course, still common to have ties. Indeed, if in our example we considered anything “5 or greater” to be material, it’s back to a tie3:\\n\\n3\\n Although in this case perhaps the problem is that our standards for “materiality” are too low, as opposed to the options being too good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttribute\\nPlayer P\\nPlayer Q\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth\\n✓\\n✓\\n\\n\\nStrength\\n✓\\n✓\\n\\n\\nSpeed\\n\\n✓\\n\\n\\nEndurance\\n✓\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal:\\n3\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo address this, we need one more rule.\\nStack-ranked attributes \\nBack to the top: (1) We’re trying to isolate the one thing that would be most impactful, and (2) complex decisions feel impossible because of a lack of smaller decisions. We’ve made some decisions already, but we need a few more to isolate the one winner.\\nWe have to decide which attributes are most important. Currently we are treating all attributes as equally important—a check mark next to “Endurance” is equal to a check mark next to “Health,” but is that really true?\\nWith a standard rubric, the fact that all attributes are not equally important drove us to reach for “weights.” But that computation confounded us with noise. Instead, we simply order attributes by importance, in a single ranked list. No numbers.\\n“Simply order them” is easy to say but not easy to accomplish, because people get stuck in circular debates:\\n\\n“Growth is more important than profit, because it’s possible to optimize our costs later.”\\n“Yeah, but if we’re unprofitable on a unit basis we’ll cause a cash-crunch, so we have to be profitable first.”\\n“Yeah, but if it’s only about profit, the best thing to do is just 10x prices, and whichever customers stay are super profitable, but that would be wrong.”\\n“Yeah, but if it’s only about revenue, the best thing to do is to sell $1 bills for $0.80, and that would be wrong.”\\n\\nThis conflict highlights the “smaller decisions” that still need to be made.\\nBoth sides are correct in saying it’s bad to maximize one thing with no regard to any consequences. But surely you’ve already ensured your list contains nothing outright absurd4. So these reductio ad absurdum arguments are moot and can be ignored. Assume (and enforce that) the ideas are sensible, then decide what outcome is most important.\\n\\n4\\n If you have trouble ensuring that items are meeting basic standards, create criteria for an idea making it onto the list to begin with. Examples: it can’t be less unit-profitable than some pre-determined target, it can’t take longer than N sprints to execute, and it can’t require significant retraining of the support team.\\nA typical ordering for a VC-backed B2B company, optimizing for “growth is paramount, because if growth is there, we’ll be able to raise more money,” could be:\\n\\nRevenue growth (i.e. “the single biggest driver of equity-value”)\\nNumber-of-customers growth (i.e. “market share”)\\nProduct experience (i.e. “customers love of the product”)\\nSupport cost (i.e. “a cost; more importantly, a measure of usability”)\\nInfrastructure cost (i.e. “a cost; should organically improve with scale”)\\nNet-profit expansion (i.e. “profitable business model”)\\n\\nA bootstrapped company designed to create wealth for its founders and employees, while being a place where employees genuinely love coming to work and customers genuinely love the product, might be:\\n\\nCash-basis profit expansion (i.e. “wealth creation” + “mandatory to keep the business alive”)\\nProduct experience (i.e. “the reason we get up in the morning is building a great product people love”)\\nFun (i.e. “I built this business to be the place I want to work for”)\\nNumber-of-customers growth (i.e. “stagnation is the prelude to death”)\\nMinimizing number of employees (i.e. “we joined a small company to avoid bureaucracy”)\\n\\nThese are generic attributes; “more revenue” could include almost anything. It’s better if your lists are more specific, based on current circumstances, or focused on a subset of the strategy. For example, suppose a product that targets mid-sized restaurant chains is having trouble with customer retention. A better list might be:\\n\\nDramatic increase in usability  The #1 reason customers give us when they cancel in their first year, is that training their employees is too difficult, so the software never gets used.\\nReduce costs  Price is the #1 reason that long-tenured customers give when they switch to a competitor; reducing costs means we can reduce prices while generating the same profit.\\nIncrease market-differentiation  If there were features that customers couldn’t get anywhere else, they would stay despite (1) and (2).\\n\\nNote how obvious corporate goals like “grow revenue” and “happy customers” are embedded in these goals, but insights or data produce more specific immediate goals. This will cause even better ideas to be selected, and will help the team brainstorm better ideas in the first place.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nBinstack: The final process \\nYou’ve finally made all the “small decisions” that make the big decision clear. With your stack-ranked attributes and binary scores of which items materially affect which attributes, here’s what you do:\\n\\nCross out items that don’t materially address the top-ranked attribute.\\nFor the second attribute…\\n\\nIf no tasks address it, move on to the next attribute.\\nIf exactly one remaining task addresses it, that’s the winner; you’re finished.\\nIf multiple remaining tasks affect it, cross out all the others and continue on to the next attribute.\\n\\n\\nRepeat step (2) for the third attribute, fourth, etc.\\n\\nThese steps honor our smaller decisions about which results are most important to manifest (ordered attributes), and what these options really accomplish for us (binary materiality). It also ensures that we’ll materially affect our #1 attribute; even if another idea moves several other needles, we still have to honor our “small decision” about what is of paramount importance.\\nThe final decision is trivial to explain. It goes something like this:\\n\\nWe decided the most important things we have to accomplish in the next few months are to grow top-line revenue and create defensible technology. Item P does both of these things; none of our other choices did.\\n\\nOr defending why you didn’t pick some other item:\\n\\nItem Q is a solid idea; indeed it would both increase profitability and increase our differentiation in the market. However, the most important thing right now is to grow revenue, and item P accomplishes that whereas item Q doesn’t. However, in future, if we change our priorities, or complete item P, item Q will be wonderful to consider!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-life errata \\n“Effort” conspicuously absent \\nMany rubrics are set up as “ROI” calculators, i.e. measuring impact relative to the cost of achieving that impact. This often results in selecting less-impactful items, because they are cost-effective to implement. Sometimes that’s the right choice, but Binstack is about selecting only for maximum impact, not cost-efficiency.\\nIf you actually want to maximize ROI, use this method. And here’s how you decide which method is right for your current decision.\\nFun is underrated. Add it in. \\nIt’s still possible to tie. If you have lots of items left over, perhaps your materiality threshold isn’t high enough; raise it to thin the herd.\\nSupposing you have two ideas that are truly indistinguishable, you could flip a coin. I don’t recommend that, because you can’t explain your choice. A person passionate about the choice you rejected would be upset to hear you ruled against them so flippantly. Instead, pick whichever item the folks doing the work want to do. Do what’s fun.\\nIt still sounds flippant. What business does “fun” have in business? When people work on something fun, they work harder and better while enjoying themselves more—more productivity yet more happiness. Do not dismiss this life-hack.\\nOf course we cannot do what’s fun at the expense of what needs to be done, but when those two things are not in conflict, why would you not round off in favor of fun?\\nIf you like this idea, take it further: Put “fun” in the attribute stack-rank, and rank it high. Even second position is not ridiculous. Knock that #1 priority out of the park while having fun. What’s wrong with that?\\nEvolving stack-rankings, and different stack-rankings per team \\nYou should expect the stack-ranking to change over time, even rapidly. In the early days of a company, just getting any customers is hard, at any price, so that might be much more important than revenue or profit. A mature company who reliably gets customers in the door might be more interested in expanding efficiency or profitability, not because growth is unimportant, but because it’s so systematic that it is no longer an existential threat, and other things are more pressing.\\nIf you have multiple teams, and therefore the time to execute multiple items, you might want separate lists for different goals. For example, you might say, “We want one initiative that will materially increase profit, one that materially increases our internal effectiveness or efficiency, and all the rest should maximize growth.” Each of those would be the number-one item in its own stack-ranked list, and the attributes below that might be copied from the company-wide general list.\\nIn all cases, remember to hone the attributes with more specificity, to generate better ideas.\\nWhat if nothing is left? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve generally found that the best product ideas live at the intersection of “duh” and “holy shit.\\n—Aaron Levie\\n\\n\\nSometimes we’re so harsh with our materiality threshold that none of our ideas meet our exacting standards. What does that mean?\\nIt means your ideas aren’t good enough. It means your problem wasn’t one of prioritization after all, but rather of not having ideas worth prioritizing.\\nFocus the team on this new, more pressing problem: To generate better ideas. Here’s some help with generating better ideas.\\nBut this will take time! Fine, put it in the sprint. But we need a plan right now! Too bad; it’s better to take a month to find a wonderful thing to spend the rest of the year on, than to plod along doing things that aren’t valuable enough. Do high-ROI small projects in the meantime.\\nWhy bother scoring everything when most will be rejected immediately? \\nIndeed, you needn’t bother. That saves time.\\nHowever, remember that an important aspect of decision-making is explaining your decision. Often, explaining “why not Q” is just as important as explaining “why P.” Other people will want to know that you seriously considered other options.\\nMost importantly, there are people who really wish you had selected Q. Maybe Q was even their idea. The rejection will be easier to accept if Q was seriously and genuinely considered. Perhaps, by being invited into the decision process, the person who invented Q will come to the right conclusion on their own. This is important; do not underestimate the human—and humane—part of the process.\\nReductive \\nBinstack can feel reductive—over-simplified, ignoring the reality of a complex world, therefore resulting in an incorrect conclusion. It is true that for complex problems like foreign policy, national economics, and climate change, a reductive approach is invalid.\\nBut for finding the right feature to build, or the right marketing campaign to launch, or the right bug-tracking software to adopt, or the right database to use for a new project, or the best candidate to hire, being (intelligently) reductive is how you transcend the noise, arrive at a clear decision, and explain it to others.\\nThis isn’t foreign policy, it’s a feature list. Make an impact with Binstack, and be happy!\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/maximized-decision/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBinstack: Making a maximal multi-dimensional decision\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Why rubrics don’t add upSolution: Binstack: Stack-ranked binary attributesBinary materialityStack-ranked attributesBinstack: The final processReal-life errata“Effort” conspicuously absentFun is underrated.

Frameworks range from poster-sized interconnected networks of boxes and arrows, to reductively selecting a single North Star metric to rule them all, to cascading goals like OKRs. An organization should pick whichever framework is most likely to be adopted and honored.\\nI used to believe that “one true metric” with a smattering of operational indicators was the best way to focus a team on “what matters most.” But I’ve come to believe in a more comprehensive system, that addresses all of the needs outlined in the opening paragraph.\\nHere is that system. Because all departments can “see themselves” in the result, I believe it makes stakeholders more comfortable, while giving the product team at the center of the maelstrom a practical view, not only of everything they do, but of everything they affect. It allows the team to measure things in the short-run while also maintaining the long view.\\nMetrics as a (simplified) value-chain \\nA product sits in the middle of a chain of events, executed by the team, customers, and peers across all departments. The first step in understanding metrics, is to plot these events in time, by actor, and by the type of so-called “value” we might measure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Click to Enlarge)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse color to specify which metrics you are maximizing vs satisficing. Often “maximizers” are critical for the success of the product, whereas “satisficers” are important operational indicators that can’t be ignored, and require attention if they become a problem1, but under normal circumstances shouldn’t distract us from what is most important.\\nOnce you have this map, the metrics almost write themselves. Each box has one or more metrics that explains whether “it is happening” or “we’re making progress.” You could go a step further, adding arrows2 to indicate influences or funnels or conversions, adding metrics to each arrow.\\n\\n1\\n At WP Engine we’re very happy with Google’s system for managing SLOs, in which “satisficing” KPIs are tracked continuously, but the team acts only when a KPI slips into “violation” territory, as opposed to fielding requests to invest in improving those KPIs. This threshold is pre-agreed with stakeholders, in periodic meetings outside of high-emotion catastrophes, when everyone can soberly decide under what circumstances we will interrupt high-value work to address a critical problem.\\n2\\n Also called a systems diagram, it could make the chart too busy, especially when “many things affect many things,” resulting in a dizzying bird’s nest of arrows. Perhaps the simplicity of “boxes only” outweighs the benefit of specifying all the value-flows. Or maybe include only the few, most-important arrows.\\nThe axis of “time, immediacy, and control” \\nThe horizontal axis emphasizes that some events happen prior to activity controlled by the product team, and some happen after. Most metrics frameworks have this concept of “leading” and “lagging” indicators, though some confusingly mix them all together3.\\n\\n3\\n For example, often top-level OKRs are multi-input, lagging indicators, whereas team KPIs might be immediate, and it’s unclear where leading indicators go. This leads to unhappy conversations when teams meet their immediate KPIs, but the company’s overall KPIs appear unaffected.\\nBetween those temporal bookends, we highlight that some of a product team’s activity can (1) be measured immediately and (2) the team is in full control of those effects, and therefore the team should be held directly accountable to those things.\\nThis resolves the typical conflict that arises when executives ask “why isn’t the team more focused on increasing revenue in the next 60 days” while the team insists “other people don’t understand that we’re doing a lot of important work.” Work can—and should—be measured sprint-by-sprint, whereas revenue is a multi-input, lagging indicator of success. The product team is responsible for generating revenue, but it is not the only team or actor contributing to that final result, and a change in the product can take a while to show up in revenue; individual features often cannot be directly linked to revenue at all.\\nThis doesn’t make “revenue” less important—indeed, it might be the most important metric! Rather, we have placed the metric in context, and understood that it can lag by months or even years4, and therefore isn’t a good measure of what’s happening right now. If we’re successful at our “work” but not our “financial impact,” our conversation is naturally directed towards diagnosing that disconnect. If we’re not even successfully completing our “work,” or if the features that we made aren’t being used often, those are immediate facts and within the team’s control, and metrics should reveal it, regardless of downstream consequences on revenue. You can’t argue against solving for the customer!\\n\\n4\\n Blackberry’s revenue continued to grow for two years after the iPhone launched; other KPIs were changing far more rapidly, and therefore were even more important to track.\\nNotice that often the “definition of success” also resides in those lagging indicators. This is another traditional cause of confusion, often articulated as “we should celebrate outcomes, not work.” It is true that if our work doesn’t result in the desired outcomes, we’re not finished yet. But, if we believe that the world is inherently unpredictable, that not all work will yield a large outcome, that outcomes require a combination of execution and luck, then we should agree that the job of an agile team is to continuously tackle that complex challenge, as opposed to expecting every idea to consistently produce the desired outcome.\\nSeeing how all the metrics are performing gives the team and stakeholders the information needed to completely understand what’s going on. Which is the whole point of KPIs.\\nThe agile team must honestly and clearly measure both direct results and lagging outcomes. They are accountable for all of it, and measuring is required for accountability. But “not yet achieving the outcome” is not a complete failure, but rather a learning that will shape the work that will be executed in the next two weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the result confirms the hypothesis, then you’ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you’ve made a discovery.\\n—Enrico Fermi\\n\\n\\nThe axis of “hidden, internal, external, and strategic” \\nWe control what we do in our sprint; we don’t control what customers do. The company controls what other teams are doing; the product team doesn’t directly control that (much to the chagrin of product managers).\\nIt’s useful to draw a bright line between what is external and what is internal. Often completely different people work in these two domains, e.g. product, design, support, and sales working directly with customers, whereas engineering, infrastructure, and security work inside the company. The diagram helps us appreciate everyone’s role, and use the right metrics for the right things.\\nFurthermore, some internal activities are close to the customer (e.g. releasing new features), while others are far away (e.g. applying a security patch). If all our work is invisible, we have a problem: Customers perceive a stagnant product, competitors appear to be moving faster, sales doesn’t have new things to say. On the other hand, if we value only the visible things, we end up with a bad product, with tech debt and unhappy engineers with slow delivery due to an under-invested foundation. The diagram makes this clear, honoring all of these important types of work.\\nThe most valuable, strategic outcomes are often even more distant from the product team, whether because they are down-stream, or because they are second-order effects for the customer. We control “satisfaction” more than self-motivated external “advocacy,” yet the latter is clearly not only the ultimate measure of the success of the product, but also drives efficient growth. Product teams should take ownership of creating those outcomes, while not allowing those lagging, multi-factor metrics to be the only way we measure progress.\\nThe most valuable thing is for the customer to achieve their own ultimate goal, as defined by the Needs Stack. If the customer’s business doesn’t thrive, they’ll stop paying for your software, no matter how good the software is. While of course the customer’s business is again a multi-factor, lagging metric, where nearly all the factors are outside of your control, it’s still ultimately the greatest form of value. Even if you can’t control it, you can notice the attributes of customers who tend to thrive, and direct your marketing, sales, and features towards that subset of the market, yielding higher growth and retention, and likely higher profitability.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nChecklist for great metrics \\nFrom SMART goals to FAST goals to North Star Metrics, there’s plenty of prior art on how to pick good metrics. This is my own list.\\n\\nDefined in normal language\\n“Customers are using feature X” makes sense. “Total unique IPs which caused at least one event from P, Q, or R to fire in our analytics system over a rolling 14 day period, divided by total unique IPs from the same system in the same period” is a precise way of measuring “using feature X,” but it’s too hard for normal people to scan and understand.\\nDefined precisely\\nIn the previous example, you need that technical definition also. Frequently that definition is where we realize either (a) we can’t get exactly the metric we wanted, or (b) we have to do engineering work before we get the metric we want. This is especially important with concepts like “cancellation rate” or “cost to acquire a customer” which can be defined in myriad ways; it’s often useful to use different precise definitions for different metrics within the same company.\\nMatches the intent\\nOften the technical metric doesn’t actually measure what we stated in plain language. For example, we intend to measure “User Portal usage” but instead we measure “User Portal logins,” which only triggers when someone’s session expires. It is common to want to measure P, but P is too difficult or maybe even impossible, so we pick a proxy metric Q. That can be OK, but make sure the proxy really does measure the intended concept.\\nCauses action\\nIf the metric does something differently from what we expect, would we act? Would we re-plan the next sprint, or even interrupt the current one? If the answer is “no,” it doesn’t belong on our main metrics board. It might belong on an operational board, if it’s explanatory, helping us to understand how things are functioning.\\nObvious what “good” look like\\nNot all metrics should be attached to explicit goals, because some are for monitoring and understanding the situation, as opposed to something we’re actively trying to change or maintain. However, it should be obvious “what good looks like.” That could be as simple as “not changing,” or directional rather than specific (e.g. “usage increasing” as opposed to “usage going up 10% month-over-month”).\\nMeasures “what is happening” (not “work”)\\nYou already track work; metrics shouldn’t duplicate or summarize that. Metrics are about “what is happening” around us—the dials on the airplane dashboard, not the actions the pilots are taking. (Exception: Metrics that explicitly measure whether we are completing a volume or quality of work.) If the metric can be moved by, or applies to only one possible course of action, it’s measuring work and even presupposing solutions, instead of measuring “what is.”\\nMeasured easily\\nMany metrics are useful, but remain un-updated in spreadsheets because it’s too hard to get them. Best is automated; second-best is manual-but-trivial.\\nMeasured frequently\\nDaily is best. One of the advantages of “rolling N days” is that you can update it daily, yet still think in units like “week” or “month” if that’s sensible. Caveat: if the number doesn’t naturally change frequently, then it’s not important to measure it frequently. Still, in that case you won’t check it often, which diminishes its value.\\nStable definition and applicability\\nMeasure things whose definition is stable over time, ensuring that any observed changes are the result of deliberate actions or environmental shifts, rather than random fluctuations or alterations in the nature of measurement itself. This stability allows for meaningful month-to-month comparisons and more accurate assessments of strategies and outcomes.\\nUses common definitions when possible\\nIt’s tempting to invent your own metric, even when there are so-called “industry standards” or “best-practices.” Standard definitions might not be appropriate for your business, or violate one of the other rules above. Inventing your own language is also a form of team-cohesion. However, reinventing the wheel makes it harder for others to understand what you’re doing and precludes using benchmarks to see whether your metric is “good” objectively. There are even metrics where special definitions hide the signal; sometimes these are even used for deception5. Don’t do that.\\n\\n\\n5\\n Common examples are revenue-recognition, classifying costs in or out of COGS/GPM, and conveniently leaving certain costs out of EBITDA.\\n\\nSignal at least 2x stronger than noise\\nMetrics often vary for reasons unrelated to the underlying signal.\\nMonthly revenue is like this—new, upgrade, and cancellation alike. Calendar months vary their number of days by ±5%. Furthermore, daily numbers can vary by 2x between a week-day and week-end, and calendar months vary in the number of weekdays by ±10%. So, if you’re tracking something like new revenue per month, even a real change as large as 10% is the same size as the noise, so you can’t actually tell if there was a real change.\\nSometimes a clever alteration to the definition can remove noise. For example, “new revenue over rolling 28 days” eliminates the two factors just mentioned, and is fairly close to a calendar-month worth of revenue6. Or if noise is infrequent, something like “median” or “95%tile” can ignore outliers.\\nBut often noise is less predictable. In that case, it’s useful to ask how much is noise, and whether it’s so much that the metric isn’t useful. If you don’t know how much is noise, it’s probably a bad metric.\\n\\n\\n6\\n To make it an “average calendar month,” you can multiply your trailing 28-day figure by 52/48, which scales it to the average number of weeks in a month.\\nI hope this system will be as useful to you as it has been for us.\\n\\nMany thanks to Jaakko Piipponen, Jonathan Drake, and Vinod Valloppillil for contributing insights to early drafts.\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSelecting the right product metrics (KPIs)\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Metrics as a (simplified) value-chainThe axis of “time, immediacy, and control”The axis of “hidden, internal, external, and strategic”Checklist for great metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

When something is so consistent, it must be wisdom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA primary blocker of progress, from our personal lives to our corporate strategies, is a\\n\\nFailure to face the truth\\n\\n“The truth hurts.” Yeah, so we avoid it. The truth is hard to find if we’re not looking for it, and we’re not. Denial (when intentional) and rationalization (when unintentional) is our normal operating mode. Because we don’t realize this, it’s an immense, invisible barrier. Whether because we don’t like to admit we’re wrong (even to ourselves, in secret), or because it will be annoying or painful or career-altering for the truth to be said aloud, we avoid the truth.\\nOnce you start seeing the pattern of “failure to face the truth,” you see it everywhere. In almost every meeting, someone is thinking something and not saying it, even though one of the best uses of a meeting is to unveil and discuss insights. In every strategy discussion, there’s a monster in the room no one will name, even though the point of strategy is to identify and then construct a battle plan against the monsters. Written plans and strategies are all optimism and confirmatory data, rather than crystalizing the scary challenges so that we can attack them together.\\nThose who break through this barrier are rewarded, as many famous books and frameworks point out. It’s fun to see this in action, because the examples are individually interesting, and because a totality of instances illuminates the pattern.\\nRadical Candor \\n“When you say ‘um’ every third word, it makes you sound stupid.” Not the feedback Kim Scott was hoping for after what she thought was a successful presentation to executives at Google. And it came from Sheryl Sandberg of all people. (Before she joined Facebook).\\nNow Scott knew, that Sandberg knew, that Scott wasn’t stupid. Therefore, it was obvious to her that this feedback was meant to help, not “obnoxious aggression” as Scott would later name the same straightforwardness when the motives are to belittle and hurt rather than to coach. And so Scott was grateful for being made to “face the truth.” In her words:\\n\\nWhy had nobody told me for 15 years? It was like I’d been walking through my whole career with a hunk of spinach between my teeth and nobody had had the courtesy to tell me it was there.\\n\\nThe truth is a courtesy; conversely, failure to face the truth is at least impolite, and at worst “ruinous” in Scott’s terminology, as when a manager withholds necessary feedback for fear of hurt feelings or being seen as unkind.\\nScott is now famous for promulgating this philosophy of direct, honest, empathetic facing-of-the-truth in her book, Radical Candor. It starts with a foundation of personal trust—trust that the feedback-giver genuinely cares for the well-being of the feedback-receiver, and that it is given in the spirit of “facing the truth” and not in the spirit of domination or manipulation or other ill-intent that people in positions of power might visit upon those subject to that power.\\nWe’re thankful when a coach admonishes us and shows us a better way; a coach that lied to you, even by omission, telling you everything is fine when it isn’t, would be a bad coach.\\nFive Dysfunctions of a Team \\nPossibly the most famous book on diagnosing problems in team dynamics and building high-functioning teams, Five Dysfunctions by Patrick Lencioni starts with the observation that great teams are built in layers, each requiring the next to be effective:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Click to Enlarge)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExactly like Scott’s Radical Candor, it is critical that a team be capable of constructive conflict, “discussing the real issues,” facing the truth. That requires the team to first build trust, so that it is safe to have conflict.\\n“Failure to face the truth,” together, in the open, prevents teams from being great. We must have enough trust in each other to face the truth, together. If someone can’t handle that trust, maybe they’re not right for the group after all.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nGood Strategy, Bad Strategy \\nIn one of the seminal books defining “strategy,” Richard Rumelt lists common hallmarks of bad strategy. Each one is so common, you’ll shake your head and laugh (or cry, if you’re guilty of these sins):\\n\\n• Fluff. Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses [non-specific or] esoteric concepts to create the illusion of high-level thinking.\\n• Failure to face the challenge. Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it.\\n• Mistaking goals for strategy. Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles.\\n• Bad strategic objectives. A strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end. Strategic objectives are “bad” when they fail to address critical issues or when they are impracticable.\\n—Richard Rumelt, Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, p32\\n\\nHis phrase “Failure to face the challenge” is my inspiration for “Failure to face the truth.” Strategy must identify and then address the most important and difficult facts-of-the-matter of the market, competitive space, customers, product, and team.\\nIt’s scary to say “Our market is shrinking,” but if it’s true, and you refuse to identify it, if you don’t write it down that crisply, if you don’t challenge the company to come up with alternatives for how to address it, if you don’t build a strategy that expressly attacks it head-on, then it will be fatal. Face the truth.\\nLazy language belies a deeper failure \\nThere are traces of “failure to face the truth” even in Rumelt’s other bullets. Fluffy language is a personal peeve of mine. In the benign case it is simple laziness—avoiding the work of crafting prose by filling the requisite space on the page with jargon and generic phrases. In the worst case, it belies the lack of having thoughts in the first place.\\nThis problem is rampant in marketing and content-marketing, but sticking with the theme of strategy, it’s especially common in “vision” or “mission” statements, theoretically summarizing the company’s aspirations, but often just a non-specific blob that also applies to any other company in the space, e.g.\\n\\nA leading provider of website development for businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nWell, that was easy! Easy because it says almost nothing, and as a result, it’s wrong. Wrong because it doesn’t develop websites both for coffee farmers in Ethiopia and also for Tesla’s launch of their next vehicle (“all sizes”).\\nPerhaps it’s mere laziness; after all, the only words that communicate anything about what it is, is “website development.” Or perhaps the company refuses to “face the truth” of what it really does, and who it really serves, where it’s really strong but also weak, afraid to say “no” to any potential customer. What if, instead:\\n\\nWe are boutique artisans chosen by discerning businesses who demand the highest-quality, completely unique web experiences.\\n\\nSounds like a small company (“boutique”) who nevertheless charges a lot (also “boutique”), but delivers amazing work (“discerning” and “unique”). By saying “no” to people who don’t want that, you get to say “yes” to interesting projects at profitable rates, even beating out larger competitors who you can argue are just “factories that churn out the same website with different colors.” But only if you face the truth.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nConfront the brutal facts \\nIn Good to Great, one of the most-cited books on the formula (if such a thing exists) for successful businesses, Jim Collins frequently returns to the story of A&P and Kroger—two companies alike in dignity in fair 1960s America, where we lay our scene—yet Kroger catapulted past A&P because, in Collins’s words, only Kroger was willing to “confront the brutal facts.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKroger and A&P grew about the same for twenty years, both under-performing the broader market. Grocery stores are hard.\\n(Source: Good to Great)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKroger exploded with success after “confronting the brutal facts,” while A&P continued to falter.\\n(Source: Good to Great)\\n\\n\\nCollins tells a fantastic story, abridged here:\\n\\nA&P stood as the largest retailing organization in the world and one of the largest corporations in the United States, at one point ranking behind only General Motors in sales. Kroger, in contrast, stood as an unspectacular grocery chain, less than half the size of A&P.\\n…\\nA&P had a perfect model for the first half of the twentieth century … cheap, plentiful groceries sold in utilitarian stores. But in the affluent second half of the twentieth century, Americans changed. They wanted … bigger stores, … fresh-baked bread, flowers, cold medicines, forty-five choices of cereal, and ten types of milk. … and they wanted to do their banking and get their annual flu shots. In short, they no longer wanted grocery stories. They wanted super-stores.\\n…\\nHere’s what’s interesting: Both Kroger and A&P were old companies heading into the 1970s [Kroger 82, A&P 111]; both companies had nearly all their assets investing in traditional grocery stores; both had strongholds outside of the major growth areas of the United States; and both companies had knowledge of how the world around them was changing. Yet one of these companies confronted the brutal facts of reality head-on and completely changed its entire system in response; the other stuck its head in the sand.\\n\\nCollins goes on to detail this last sentence—how both companies were fully aware of these changes, A&P even opening a test store under a different name, which was a “super-store” that didn’t even sell A&P items, which outperformed their standard stores. Not wanting to face those facts, they shuttered the test store and went back to business-as-usual. Meanwhile, Kroger made the same experiments, found the same results, and decided to pivot the entire company to become the modern-day supermarket.\\nA&P saw the truth, but failed to face the truth. Whether it’s Jim Collins analyzing dozens of companies or Rumelt with his experience with dozens of strategies, the pattern is the same: Face the truth, or be killed by it.\\nWhen it’s hard, we avoid it \\nIt seems obvious that avoiding the truth would lead to bad outcomes, so why do we do it? Because it’s hard. It’s not the only obvious thing in our lives that we avoid, solely because it’s hard. Diet? Exercise? Giving feedback? Working on our relationships?\\nIt’s hard to tell the truth to someone’s face. It’s hard to realize that your industry has completely shifted, and it’s really hard to say that out loud in front of the whole company. It’s hard to say “no” to a customer when you have bills to pay, and it’s hard to make a major strategic choice, because what if you’re wrong?\\nThat’s a good explanation for failure to face the truth, but it’s not a good reason.\\nFace the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nGo ahead. Faith will follow.\\n—Jean-Baptiste le Rond d’Alembert, encouraging early practitioners of calculus, even though rigorous proofs of its legitimacy were still a hundred years away.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/failure-to-face-the-truth/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFailure to face the truth\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Radical CandorFive Dysfunctions of a TeamGood Strategy, Bad StrategyLazy language belies a deeper failureConfront the brutal factsWhen it’s hard, we avoid it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Here are some tips for consulting companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsulting can be a great way to fund a startup or make a bunch of cash. It’s easy to start; Just pick an hourly rate and jump in. There are tons of online tools for time-tracking, project-management, and billing.\\nBut someday soon you’ll notice there’s only so many billable hours in the day, and you’ll be tempted to expand. Maybe hire an employee for $30 per hour and re-bill them at $60.\\xa0Easy money, right?\\nUnfortunately the math doesn’t work that way.\\nHere’s what really happens, and a few ways to combat it.\\nDouble is nothing \\nSuppose you hire an employee at $60,000/year. There are 2,000 working hours in a year—40 hours per week times 50 weeks—leaving two weeks vacation. So your cost per billable hour is:\\n\\nNominal Cost: $30/hour\\n\\nIn terms of working days (WD), there’s 250 in a 50-week year. In America we have ten federal holidays bringing the annual WD count to 240. Recomputing the cost of the remaining billable hours, we have:\\n\\n20 WD/month, $31/hour\\n\\nWe also have employment tax in America. Rules are complicated and vary by state, but as a rule of thumb you pay 15% in taxes including Medicare and Social Security. That changes the annual cost of your employee from $60,000 to $69,000 with an associated change in hourly cost:\\n\\n20 WD/month, $36/hour\\n\\nWe’ve assumed an 8-hour work day, but any owner of a consulting company will tell you this rarely happens. Oh sure, founders work 60-80-hour weeks, but not employees. Besides, even if you’re in the office 8 hours a day it’s hard to be heads-down-on-task the entire time, and consulting is about billable hours. It’s hard to be billable for 8 hours a day, every day.\\xa0From what I’ve seen the weekly billables are more like 36 hours instead of 40. That means you’re short 16 hours per month, which is equivalent to missing two full (8-hour) days. With this loss, now we’re at:\\n\\n18 WD/month, $40/hour\\n\\nThen personal life intrudes. You come in at noon because you had a morning dentist appointment. You take off early to wait for the A/C repair guy. You’re sick one day. All very reasonable and it doesn’t sound like much, but two half-days and a sick day means another two days lost:\\n\\n16 WD/month, $45/hour\\n\\nWe’ve assumed you’re able to keep your employee completely busy throughout the year without down-time between projects, but that’s unrealistic. If you get two-week gigs, maybe there’s a day between them where the timing didn’t quite work out or you did some post-contract clean-up. If you land a six-month gig, that’s better, except it’s hard to time large deals like that to start and end exactly when you want, months in advance; in fact it’s common to have 2-3 weeks of down-time between such things. Either way you lose at least 10% of your time, and that’s assuming a healthy incoming project pipeline, so knock off another two days (10% of the 20-day work-month):\\n\\n14 WD/month, $51/hour\\n\\nAnd let’s suppose you want to allocate just a little time for career development. After all, if you expect to hire and retain great people, they need time to keep learning, stay in front of the latest technology, and just have fun. Maybe that means going to a conference or two, or working on an open-source project, or learning some new tech that’s needed for work. You see what’s coming of course: That’s another 10%:\\n\\n12 WD/month, $60/hour\\n\\nThe true cost of an employee is double the nominal cost. If you bill out a so-called “$30/hour” employee at $60/hour, you’ll only break even. You really need to bill out at $100/hour to make any kind of profit.\\nWhich is hard, because the client you’re billing knows this person doesn’t cost even close to $100/hour. And when that client thinks about what’s “fair,” they won’t go through the computation I just did; they’ll base it on the person’s nominal rate plus a little profit for you. This caps the amount you can actually re-bill before client feels ripped off.\\nI hear you say: “Yeah, but at $100/hour that’s $40/hour profit, or $80,000/year to me! So that’s still really good.” But consider this: If your underling can be billed at $100/hour, can’t you bill at $150/hour at least? And if you worked just 20 hours/week (on average) at that rate you’d clear $150,000 annually without the hassle of hiring and managing an employee. Isn’t that better?\\nWhat to do? \\nSo how do you mitigate these issues? Lots of ways, few of which are compelling, but all of which are\\xa0quite do-able:\\nScale \\nIf you had five of these employees you’d be clearing $300,000 per year, which sounds better. Except not because scaling creates more time and expense:\\n\\nThe client pipeline is much harder to maintain. Keeping 3-6 projects going year-round is a full-time job in itself—a job resting on your shoulders.\\nEmployee turnover becomes more common, so you’re permanently in hiring mode. That in itself is time-consuming and expensive, and it’s hard to coordinate new hires exactly when other employees are leaving.\\nWith six people you’ll need office space with the attendant expenses, or a significant, possibly international travel budget for quarterly get-togethers.\\nWith all these new tasks, there’s no way you can also manage the projects and client relationships and internal product development, so you’ll need a project manager or a sales person or an office manager or some kind of help, and all of those come out of your profits.\\nNone of these new tasks are fun or creative. It’s drudgery, and it’s all on you. Congrats, you’re a business owner.\\n\\nWith these new expenses it’s not unusual to see that so-called $300k in profits came back to $150k. And now you’re doing things you hate doing. Scaling is hard.\\nCharge more \\nAny amount more you can charge goes straight to profits, so even charging a wee bit more (or a lot more) makes a big difference at the end of the year.\\nOften, though, charging more pushes away your existing client base, and you’ll have to find a new breed of folks willing to spend the big bucks. These are generally bigger, more dysfunctional companies with 47-page Master Service Agreements and complex, ever-changing requirements (though without an acceptance of “agile” or “lean”). It’s a living, it’s just a different living than being a Cool Cat HTML/CSS whiz doing fun projects for other entrepreneurs.\\nThis sword cuts both ways—even little discounts crater profitability. For example it’s common practice to give a 10% discount if the client pre-pays, but although it’s great to have cash up-front, that discount comes right off your bottom line. (A better idea is to raise your prices by P%, then offer a P% discount for pre-pay. Then your cash-rich customers are paying the same, but others are creating more profit in exchange for delayed payment—a reasonable trade for both parties.)\\nBill more hours \\nBilling even 5 hours more per week significantly increases profitability.\\nThe problem is convincing your employees to work more, because to them that’s “overtime” on a fixed salary. What’s in it for them?\\nOne answer: Split overtime billings with them. It’s pure profit to you and your employee can earn a significant bonus.\\nBuild a product \\nMany consulting companies have a few ideas or even working internal projects which they hope to someday turn into money-making products. The usual story is:\\n\\nWe built this product because we needed it ourselves. It gives us an advantage in consulting because it accelerates our development and enhances our sales pitch.\\nBut surely we’re not the only software developers on Earth who would find this tool useful, so whenever we have a lull in client work we work on our product. Someday that will cash-flow by itself, at much better margins.\\n\\nIndeed there are conspicuous companies who grew successful product lines in exactly this manner: 37signals, FogCreek, and Pivotal Labs. Unfortunately, for each of those there are hundreds if not thousands who toil away at pet projects which never see the light of day. Some reasons:\\n\\nConverting an internal project to a user-friendly one requires drudgery: Onboarding flows, documentation, intuitive user interface, installers, password-reset, and fixing those 200 bugs that internally you’ve just learned to work around. No one wants to do it, and it’s no one’s job to do it, so it doesn’t happen.\\nIt’s no one’s job to market or sell the product. No one has the time, and it’s quite possible that in a roomful of consultants no one has the skill-set either. So you “put it out there” hoping that the magical world of “social media word of mouth marketing” will bestow eager users upon your sign-up form. But, of course, that’s not what happens.\\nYou have five kinda-cool projects, any of which might be awesome if given enough TLC, but because your attention is spread among all of them (and even then only in fits and spurts between client work) none gets to the stage of being usable by anyone else. Lack of focus kills.\\nBillable hours trump product development; it’s always second-class, so you get a second-class side-project.\\nThinking that just because the product is “great for us,” that there’s a market out there. Usually there’s not. (Here’s how to figure it out).\\n\\nMost of the problems above can be fixed by treating the product as a client:\\n\\nThe product is listed as a client just like all the rest.\\nThe product is given a budget, even to the point of a separate bank account (and corporation?) so it’s clear how much you’ve spent on it, and the project pays consulting fees (perhaps at cost instead of full-rate).\\nHours are scheduled and prioritized like other clients, and doesn’t slip just because it’s not a “real client.”\\nIf the (potential?) income from the project cannot justify the cost, you might consider it a loss and stop completely rather than continue to limp along as a money-losing project.\\n\\nBut ultimately, it’s just hard.\\nUse subcontractors instead of employees \\nIf you pay your underlings for exactly the number of hours you rebill them, you avoid all of the issues above: No employment taxes, no worries about 36-hour weeks or vacations or project gaps. It’s simple time-arbitrage.\\nTerrific! Unfortunately, subcontractors\\xa0charge a lot by the hour—a lot more than employees. Of course they do… exactly for the reasons above!\\nYou haven’t eliminated those effects, you’ve just moved them to someone else’s profit-and-loss report. If you hired that same employee as a consultant she would charge you $60/hour instead of $30/hour and your profits are still the same.\\nStill, there’s a lot less headache using consultants, so this might still be worthwhile. Simpler taxes (in America), no bargaining for vacation time, no prodding them to bill 45 hours this week to make up for last week. Even from a psychological standpoint this might be better: It’s easier to give up $60 when you charge $100, but it causes some consternation to pay someone for a “day’s work” when there’s no work to do.\\nIs consulting really that bad? \\nConsulting is a great way to earn a living and a smart way to self-finance a startup.\\nThe trick is to avoid all these traps. For example, you know billing a full 40 hours per week is critical, so make it a habit to review hours weekly to make sure no one is consistently falling behind. As another example, set up incentives where employees get to share in the profits.\\nIt’s always hard. Most consulting companies don’t make much profit, and it’s one in a thousand that has the discipline to launch a successful product during off-hours. If you’re going to make it happen, you yourself need to be serious, disciplined, and relentless.\\nBut you can do it.\\nAnd if you do, you’ve just self-financed a startup, made a nice living, mitigated much of the risk of product-only startups, and built a great team in the process.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/consulting-company-accounting/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe unfortunate math behind consulting companies\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Double is nothingWhat to do?ScaleCharge moreBill more hoursBuild a productUse subcontractors instead of employeesIs consulting really that bad?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Here’s the solution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScrum teaches us that the “single-threaded, ordered list of work” is the correct way to prioritize the work of the future. Innumerable articles—including one from this very site—tell us that a single, stack-ranked list is the simplest way to clarify priority.\\nI find, however, that this is unsatisfying at best, and fails to achieve sensible prioritization at worst. It also doesn’t solve the political challenges of prioritization with stakeholders.\\nThe following system is simple, and has worked for me.\\nPrioritization ≠ Work Planning \\nPrioritization means: What is most important?\\nCritically, it does not mean: What will we work on next?\\nProduct Managers typically conflate these, trying to do both with a single process, and a single backlog. A traditional backlog efficiently encodes the answer to the second question, but isn’t the right tool for answering the first question.\\nYou might say, “But we should work on whatever is most important, right?” By unpacking the subtle answer, we’ll arrive at a better way to prioritize, and a better way to plan work.\\nWhy “the big backlog of work” isn’t good for prioritization \\nPrioritization \\nIf prioritization answers “What is most important,” it begs another question: What do we mean by “important?”\\n\\nImportant to calm our largest customer who is threatening to leave\\nImportant to catch up to our biggest competitor on a specific feature\\nImportant to unleash the sales and marketing teams onto a new market segment\\nImportant to satisfy our security policy\\nImportant to decrease the largest cause of support tickets\\nImportant to mitigate the largest cause of cancellations\\nImportant to refactor code so that engineers are happier and more productive\\nImportant to increase profitability\\nImportant to achieve our long-term strategy, even if there’s no next-quarter revenue\\n\\nSorting a “Big List” of epics doesn’t seem like the right way to tackle this complexity.\\nThe first problem is that you’re sorting things that are incomparable. Every bullet point above names something undeniably “important” but also belies a different motivation, with different impact, measured differently, so on what basis, with what metric, would you order The Big List?\\nThe second problem is that the resulting decision is unsatisfying to stakeholders. Sales wants a few specific competitive features, and doesn’t have the context to understand how those are interleaved with requests from support or why the engineers need an entire month to “clean up a mess, which by the way, they made themselves?” The Big List doesn’t yield satisfactory explanations.\\nWork-planning \\nThe third problem is that The Big List conflates the idea of “prioritization”—what is most important—with “work-planning”—which is the order that specific work will be executed. While there’s a correlation of course, often work-planning does not match our ideal prioritization because…\\n\\nHard deadlines—often externally-imposed—requiring work even if something else is nominally “more important.” (e.g. zero-day security patch is not on our list of prioritized strategic work, but must be scheduled immediately. Or: Have to get specific functionality shipped for a live customer event).\\nWe might not currently have capacity on the teams who are capable of working on a high-priority thing.\\nWe might not currently have the skillsets to execute a high-priority thing.\\nDependencies—i.e. A is very important; B is not. But A cannot be done unless B is done. Therefore, we must work on B first, even though A is more important.\\nUnknowns that have to be investigated before work can commence, or even be planned. (e.g. spikes or proofs-of-concept)\\nThe amount of work, or amount of risk, of executing a high-priority thing might mean we shouldn’t tackle it yet.\\nGetting success on some smaller things, while working on longer things, is better for throughput, better for morale, and is more agile.\\nBlockers—dependencies on other work, maybe even other teams, before we can make progress on a high-priority thing.\\nStarving—sometimes we’ve put off low-priority things for so long, they effectively become higher-priority.\\nHolidays and other seasonal things (e.g. kicking off a huge new initiative on December 15th is a bad idea, even if it’s strategic).\\n\\nThe solution is to prioritize items in separate, actually-comparable streams, and to keep that prioritization effort cleanly separate from work-planning.\\nSeparate prioritization streams \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t cross the streams!\"\\n“Why?”\\n“It… would be bad.\\n—Egon Spengler, Ghostbusters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stakeholders \\nFolks in Sales may not know which items are most important for Support, but they sure as heck have an opinion on what would be best for Sales! It’s fun to sit down with sales reps and sales leaders and ask them to generate and then stack-rank1 the things they believe would be most impactful. Tell them they don’t have to worry about other departments or other requirements—this time is just for them, and this list is just for them.\\n\\n1\\n Wait, that means a single, prioritized list! Yes. Because this is a single group, and we’re asking them a single question from the bullet-list above (e.g. “what would be best for increasing sales, whether because of increased win-rate or increased average transaction size”), we don’t have the problem of comparing unlike things, and so the “single list” is a good forcing-function to generate a clear prioritization.\\nThe ideas will pour out. Some ideas come from the last sale someone lost; that might be insightful or might be noise2. Some ideas are critical causes of lost sales; bonus points if you can tie them to specific lost-sales; that’s motivating for Engineering as much as for Product. Some ideas are just a feeling—“I know I could sell the piss out of X.” Don’t dismiss those out of hand in your quest to be data-driven; multi-billion-dollar startups have been built atop experience-informed gut-instinct.\\n\\n2\\n One way to separate the short-term emotional reaction from the important trend is to observe what happens in subsequent prioritization sessions. When you see the group dramatically shifting the priority of items quarter-to-quarter, that indicates the group doesn’t have a consistent sense of what would be most impactful. Surely some of the ideas are truly great; this team just isn’t sure which ones those are. Sounds familiar—Product Managers struggle with this challenge all the time!\\nBy forcing that group to stack-rank their ideas, they’ll argue amongst themselves over which are most impactful. This creates empathy for what product managers have to do all the time—struggle with prioritization in the face of multiple goals and imperfect data. It also means they can’t make everything “Priority #1,” which in turn sets up a healthier future discussion: When, in two months, they complain that “you still haven’t made feature X,” you can point out that “X” was number seven on their list, so they themselves felt that it wasn’t as important; you were just listening to their input. (Of course, everyone is allowed to change their mind; it’s useful to run this process multiple times per year.)\\nYou’re not promising to do everything they want, in the order they want. That’s work-planning, and also this is just one list; you’re going to do this with other groups too. And this list doesn’t include the most important voice of all—the voice of the customer. You are promising that you will take this list seriously, because you genuinely value their input. That’s more than most Sales teams get out of Product Managers.\\nNow repeat for other groups.\\nSales Engineering has a view unique from Sales, more technical and more in tune with technical customers, often the users rather than the buyers.\\nSupport often knows the product better than anyone, and with the right tools and processes, has better data about which topics are causing the most problems or confusion. Remember that this isn’t only about reducing work and costs for the Support team—although that’s already a great result. It’s about creating a better customer experience, because the customer who never needs to contact Support to get their work done, is a happier, more successful, more loyal customer3.\\n\\n3\\n There are fascinating data supporting the claim that “needing Support less” is correlated with “customer loyalty.“\\nEngineering also needs their own list. There’s always things to refactor, libraries to replace, spikes for new technology to try, replacement of a continuous-integration system, test automation we neglected before but desperately need now, systems that were adequate last year, but now we’ve scaled out of, and so on. Their stuff is about operational excellence and a happy, fewer-bugs, higher-productivity environment, not about growth or the customer. Therefore, it’s easy for these things to never be prioritized, which in the long run creates resentment and grinds development velocity to a halt. But also, engineers—like everyone else—have more ideas than time, so they should be forced to stack-rank.\\nSo… which of these lists are correct? There is truth in all, but none contain the complete picture, like the 2,500-year-old Buddhist allegory about the The Blind Men and The Elephant:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: J. Himmelfarb (artist G. Renee Guzlas)\\n\\n\\nIt’s the job of a Product Manager to consider all of these inputs and deduce the elephant. Keeping the inputs separate and stack-ranked helps the PM with this daunting endeavor.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nThe customer \\nThese are internal groups; what about the customer, the star of the show! This is typically the purview of Product Managers and Designers and UX Researchers, as opposed to internal stakeholders. For simple products, perhaps there’s only one prioritized list representing our best idea of what’s important to the customer, but products with non-overlapping areas of functionality or that serve multiple personas might have one list per persona or functional space. So for example you might have separate lists for the needs of small versus large companies, or first-time users versus power-users.\\nAnother common technique is to have a list per step in the customer journey, reflecting the fact that it’s important for trial users to find success quickly, and also important for paying customers to continuously see value, and also important that the highest-revenue power-users to stay and grow. As with stakeholders, the motivation for the prioritizing items within each category are not comparable.\\nThere is plenty of prior art on this topic. This is essentially what is happening with Story Mapping or Opportunity Solution Trees, where the customer-journey steps or the main opportunities each contain a list of potential work-items. Indeed, you could argue that story-mapping is just exactly the idea expounded here, extending the concept of “independent lists” from only customer-focused topics, to topics from Sales, Support, and Engineering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlternate types of list \\nIf you don’t like separating lists by function or by customer journey, here are other systems that some people like to use:\\nKano \\nYou could also create lists using the Kano Model. Imagine one list each for Delight, Performance, and Must-Be. In general you don’t want to starve any one of these categories, but it’s difficult to prioritize items between categories. For example, it’s easy to claim that everything in “Must-Be” has to be implemented first; after all it’s called “Must-Be” for a reason! There’s no point in bringing on new customers who won’t be successful. That sounds reasonable, but it’s simply not true that products should supply only basic requirements; indeed it’s often the (unexpectedly) Delightful items that cause a customer to stay despite failings. Having separate lists, none of which should be completely starved, helps to combat this problem.\\nThe “Four Lists” \\nFrom Jyoti Bansal, summarized by Adam Thornhill:\\n\\nCustomer engagement. Tuning into user feedback and desires.\\nSales intelligence. Learning from the field to stay abreast of the competition.\\nTechnical debt. The debt engineers must address to prevent performance issues.\\nVision for the future. Where the product should head, expanding the addressable market.\\n\\n\\nIn all cases, all of the lists are important, in the sense that you cannot ignore any one of them forever. But you don’t have capacity to move all the needles at once, and the items within each list are different-in-kind, and should be prioritized separately.\\nCrossing the streams for work-planning \\nEventually, human beings need to do work. It makes sense to select work from these various streams and—yes—place the work in an ordered backlog. When you’re actually doing work, you want a clear answer to “what’s next?” without additional meetings and debate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy waiting until the last second to compare incomparable things, prioritization remains organized and clear. By waiting until the last second to shift your mindset from “most important” to “planning work,” you maximize clarity in the process of selecting and scheduling work.\\nIn software, when you wait until the last possible moment to do something, it’s called JIT (“Just In Time”), hence the titular name of this technique.\\nYou still have the unenviable job of selecting which items from which streams are going to happen next (or “soon,” in the case of a roadmap). But that was always going to be the case—there’s always more work than time, so there’s always a selection process. This technique keeps that process more organized than it would have been, and it allows you to grapple with work-planning puzzles separately from prioritization, which at least compartmentalizes the challenge. Divide-and-conquer is a good way to overcome complexity.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’re obviously in no danger of arriving at consensus.\\n—Warren Buffet\\n\\n\\nYou’re selecting from the top ideas at the company, not from the 1000 ideas everyone collectively has. It’s a lot easier to pick the best from 12 instead of from 1000, and in some sense you can’t go wrong—on average all 12 are probably decent ideas. And stakeholders will be happy.\\nThis last point is under-appreciated. This process is more explainable after-the-fact. Suppose it turns out Sales’s first item is impossible to tackle right now, but you can knock out their second item because, by the way, it’s also Support’s number four and fits nicely into a multi-month customer journey improvement project you have. That’s a great message to send back. Or, a message like: We knocked out two of your top items recently; we’ve been starving the engineering list so we’re going to hit a few of those in the next few months, then resurface.\\nThis process also helps keep yourself honest. You can easily report on:\\n\\nHow much of each kind of work are we doing?\\nWhat is the age of the top three items on each list? (i.e. Are we starving something?)\\nHow much of this sprint is addressing someone’s “top 3” thing?\\nHow much work is related to internal projects versus customer-facing?\\n\\nIt also leads to better ideas:\\n\\nAre there trends that everyone is seeing across all functions in the business, that therefore should inform our strategy?\\nCan we think of new product ideas that hit multiple top-three items simultaneously, and thus are especially impactful?\\n\\nDon’t forget to schedule rocks, then pebbles, then sand. That’s an even more primary principle for work-planning. Separate prioritization streams help identify which rocks and pebbles should be scheduled in the first place.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: “Warren, think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.\\n—Warren Buffet on Charlie Munger\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/jit-backlogs/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nJIT selection from independent streams: An alternative to the “big backlog” of work\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Prioritization ≠ Work PlanningWhy “the big backlog of work” isn’t good for prioritizationPrioritizationWork-planningSeparate prioritization streamsThe stakeholdersThe customerAlternate types of listCrossing the streams for work-planning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Beyond Impostor Syndrome: Complete melt-down? Well, at least you’re in good company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve been there too. It sucks.\\nMost startups fail “only” because the founders stop working on them, and often it’s because it’s emotionally draining. I don’t care who you are or how strong your ego is, you will have these moments—perhaps a continuous stream of moments—when you can’t take it anymore.\\nI cannot remember the number of times I was so overwhelmed at Smart Bear that I almost threw in the towel. Close the bank accounts, close the doors, turn off the website, bounce the email, and just…\\nstop.\\nSounds dramatic, but it’s no exaggeration. You’ll hit these walls too. I know you will because this is what people admit in little rooms with other people who truly understand and won’t name them publicly, and also there’s a steady stream of people saying it out loud on Twitter, many times per day.\\nMaybe a little commiseration will help you get through it.\\nYou expect these moments to happen at the beginning of startup life—when you’re least confident, have the worst product, and the least knowledge about your customers and the market. Paul Graham and Trevor Blackwell captured it pretty well:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pain is not limited to the beginning of the venture. It’s still there years later, despite real revenue, profitability, customers arriving every day, and a great team.\\nSince that is not obvious, I’d like to share a personal story.\\nFour years into Smart Bear I had several employees getting paid decently (which at a bootstrapped startup is hard to do!), a product that people were buying, and we were doing around a-million-a-year. Life was good!\\nI was negotiating my first true “Enterprise sale1.” This was going to be our biggest order to date—something like $200,000. (Yes, one-time revenue. It was a simpler time.) Actually “negotiating” is the wrong word because I don’t believe in price negotiation, even with enterprise sales (an area that most people claim must include automatic discounting.)\\n\\n1\\n If you aren’t familiar with the professional mosh-pit that is enterprise sales, here’s a primer.\\nThe person with whom I was negotiating wasn’t the end user, nor the boss, nor the boss’s boss, nor anyone in that chain of command. See, big companies have entire departments devoted to dealing with vendors like you and me, and when it comes to negotiating, these departments harbor terrorists with titles like “Procurement Manager” or “Strategic Sourcing Manager.”\\nI say “terrorists” because they use fear tactics to get their way, yet they have no power other than fear. Imagine the worst stereotype of a salesman, except instead of selling you something, their job is beat a discount out of you.\\nNow to be fair, many vendors do take advantage of large companies—overcharging (because “They can afford it!”), or promising one thing to the users and sneaking something else into the invoice.\\nBut mostly it’s because of the traditional enterprise sales dance, reminiscent of the lumbering mating dance of the great blue whale. The vendor asks for too much money; the client is astonished at the price. Both calmly explain that this is a deal-breaker. Then the vendor capitulates 30% but only if the client signs a three year maintenance contract (which they wanted anyway). The deal is struck.\\nThis tradition continues because of perverse, wasteful incentives. The vendor’s salesman likes this because sometimes she gets away with a high price which pads her commission check. The Procurement Manager likes this because he can show his superiors how much money he’s “saved” the company.\\nSo big companies need a Defender of Evil Vendors, I get that. But that’s not enough for these guys; it feels to me like an attack, not a parry.\\nThis is how the conversation went:\\n\\nPM: What kind of discount are you offering?\\nMe: We don’t discount; instead we put our pricing on our website so there’s no misunderstanding.\\nPM: Well I’m going to need some kind of discount. How about 30%?\\nMe: As it says on our website, we don’t discount.\\nPM: But I’m buying 400 seats!\\nMe: Yes, and we already provide a nice discount for bulk orders, which is already included on the invoice and documented on the website.\\nPM: You don’t understand, I always get a discount. I’ve done business with 47 other vendors and all of them give me at least 20% off.\\nMe: There’s always a first!\\n\\nSo far it’s actually OK—I’m the one refusing to plod through the mating ceremony, wanting to skip right to the wedding night. I expect push-back.\\nHere’s where it gets nasty. I remember sitting there on the phone getting lambasted for my intolerable ignorance about the Way It Works. I was told, and I quote, “You have no business selling anything to anyone.” My obstinate ignorance is a deal-breaker for the entire sale because of what it implies about my company in general—after all if I don’t even understand the purchasing process there’s no chance in hell my software’s going to work! Furthermore, despite my ignorance, I’m unwilling to listen to the rules, unwilling to learn, which means there’s no hope for me.\\nI’ll never forget how this ended:\\n\\nPM: OK that’s it, you give me no choice. I absolutely cannot approve this deal, and furthermore I’m recommending that we never work with your company in any capacity. At this point, even if you gave me a discount I would still reject it.\\n\\nHere’s where I’m supposed to unleash my intellectual fortitude. I won’t capitulate, will I? I won’t let this guy insult and bully me, will I? C’mon, I’m the strong-willed confident entrepreneur with the stoic well-argued voice of reason, whereas he’s the sleezeball with the tedious day-job—surely I’ll laugh as his words roll off me like water off an oiled duck’s back.\\nJust the opposite. I felt like throwing up. He’s right, who do I think I am? I’m a baby geek playing in the adult’s house and I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I have these naïve ideas about how the world should work and how people should treat one another, and it’s all just incredibly silly and ignorant. And it shows. And now this guy is going back to those other folks at the company whom I actually like, and worked hard to earn their trust, as they laugh together over can-you-believe-how-dumb-he-is and we-can’t-possibly-do-business-with-them.\\nIt’s over. They’ve seen through me. It’s just a matter of time before others do too. That’s the end of deals like this.\\nWhy am I doing this anyway? This is supposed to be fun and fulfilling but at this moment as we say in Texas I feel like ten tons of shit in a two-ton bag. What I like is writing code—why am I even trying to play this sales game? Why not just go get a job where I only worry about whether or not I can write code—because I sure as hell can do that—and let the natural salesmen do all this crap?\\nIs the money worth it? What money, we’re still bootstrapping and I still don’t get a regular salary. Is the promise of money worth it? Worth these feelings of inadequacy?\\nAfter days (yep, days) of fretting like this, it converted from despair to anger. Who the hell is this guy? Some asshole who isn’t good enough with money to be an accountant, not even slimy enough to sell cars, this guy whose only skill is to be a jerk, some guy who has never had to make payroll or take a risk or put himself out there, this schmuck is going to tell me I’m the one who isn’t good enough, I’m the one who has no business selling software?\\nWorst of all, I’m letting him make me feel like a pile of shit!\\nWell if you’re waiting for the big moment where intellectual reasoning finally defeats weak, irrational emotions, I’m sorry to disappoint you, because that moment never came. I know it’s dumb and illogical, but there it is. It’s trivial and baseless but I still carry that experience in a corner of my thoughts. That’s how emotions work.\\nBy the way, this guy turned out to be totally full of shit. He had, in fact, no power to stop the deal. When I finally got my main buying contact from that company on a conference call with the PM, the conversation was this short, and as close to word-for-word as I can recall:\\n\\nMy Guy: So, what’s holding up procurement’s approval?\\nPM: Nothing, just some paperwork, we’ll have it done by Friday.\\n\\nAll of that angst for nothing. Son of a bitch!\\nYears later I was on site at this company and I finally met this guy face to face.\\nI still felt small.\\nWant to say I’m weak? Or he’s strong?\\nWho cares, the point is: Getting through this slog of a thing that’s a startup—or anything difficult and worthwhile—doesn’t require that you’re always confident or stoic or smart or right or wise. You don’t need to match the emotional stability you see from the big bloggers. (Which is mostly a façade anyway.)\\nIt’s not even about “overcoming.” Maybe you don’t overcome, you just get through.\\nIt’s about sticking through the tough parts, whatever your foibles and weaknesses.\\nLiving through it, not beating it. I never have, to this day, “beaten” that PM, not emotionally, not if I’m being truly honest.\\nWelcome to your crucible.\\nI’m not saying tenacity is all it takes. Just that without it, you’ll stop. It’s so easy to stop. There’s so many reasons to stop.\\nAnd that—stopping—is how most little startups actually fail.\\nP.S. Since writing this article in 2011, I was able to avoid burn-out and these other thoughts with a framework that I detail in this article from 2022.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/startups-emotionally-draining/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen you want to quit because it’s just not worth it\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

But sometimes it really is smarter to take your time. Here’s how to decide.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all know that startups should make decisions quickly. Fast decisions leads to rapid action, which accelerates the loop of production and feedback, which is how you outpace and out-learn a competitor, even one that already has a lead.\\nBut some decisions should not be made in haste, like a key executive hire, or pricing strategy, or whether to raise money, or whether to invest millions of dollars in a new product line, or whether to enter a new market.\\nHow do you know when your current decision should be made slowly: contemplative, collaborative, deliberate, data-driven, even agonizing?\\nThe following scorecard will help you know whether it is wiser to go slowly:\\n\\nYou’ll make a much smarter decision later\\nToday we know the least that we’re ever going to know. Often, waiting six months doesn’t automatically give us more information, but sometimes it does. If we haven’t launched a product yet, we’re in no position to decide what the next few features should be; we should launch and earn experience through customer interactions. We’ll then be much smarter about answering that question. So, don’t waste time even thinking about it now, and certainly don’t make any firm decisions, when you know you’ll make a better one later.\\nCan’t undo\\nThis is the classic one-or-two-way door delineation. If you can’t easily undo the decision, it’s worth investing more effort into analyzing the likelihood of the upsides and risks.\\nHuge effort\\nSome things take less time to implement than to estimate or to debate (i.e. Sand). It might take two engineers one week to implement something, but a few debates and a time-boxed research project could involve an entire team for a week. This is a reason why small teams without process can produce results faster than larger teams with process. If the effort to implement the decision is smaller than the effort to make a decision, just knock it out. But if you’re deciding on a path that could take six months to measure results from, taking time up front to research is wise.\\nNo compelling event\\nIf the status quo isn’t bad, there might not be a reason why a decision should be made quickly, or at all. Without time-pressure, it’s justifiable to spend more time on the decision. Conversely, time-pressure means the more time you spend deciding, the less time you have for implementation and unanticipated problems, so you’re actually adding risk by dragging out the decision.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot accustomed to making these kinds of decisions\\nOnline marketing teams are accustomed to throwing creative things at the wall, because that’s the day-to-day reality of their job. Because they’re good at it, they don’t waste time hang-wringing over whether or not to try an advertising campaign on the latest social media platform, or which headlines to try; they just do it. Conversely, most organizations have no experience with major decisions like pricing changes or acquisitions, and most founders have no idea how to hire a great executive, or how to decide whether to invest millions of dollars in a new product line as opposed to “just throwing something out there and iterating” as was the correct path at the start of the company. When the organization has never made this type of decision before, the decision is at great risk, and being more deliberate with research, data, debate, or even outside advice, is wise.\\nDon’t know how to evaluate the options\\nEven after generating the choices, does the team understand how best to analyze them? If the company’s strategy is clear and detailed, if relevant data is at hand, if it’s clear what your goals are, if the deciding team has confidence, then the decision could be easy and fast; if these things are absent, perhaps more deliberation is needed to clarify those things. (Another technique is to use Fermi Estimation to simplify the evaluation, or Binstack to find the one best option among many.)\\nCan’t measure incremental success\\nAfter the decision is made and implementation begins, can you objectively tell whether things are going well? If yes, it is easy to course-correct, or even change the decision, in the presence of reality. But if progress will be invisible or subjective, such that you will sink person-years of time into the implementation before knowing how things are going, it’s worth spending more effort gaining confidence in the path you’ve selected.\\nImperfect information\\nBuying a house is nerve-racking, mostly because it is likely the most expensive and difficult-to-undo purchase of your life, but also because you know so little about the goods. What does the seller know but isn’t telling you? What will you not discover until you’ve moved in, or a year later? Often it is impossible to get the data or research you need to make an objective decision. When this is the case, it is sometimes wise to spend extra time gathering whatever information you can, maybe investing in reports or experts (which is what you do with a house). Or you could look at it the opposite way: If it’s impossible to get objective data informing the decision, then don’t spend lots of time debating subjective points; just make the decision from experience and even gut-check, because we just said that’s all you have to go on anyway, and experts are often wrong.\\nDecision requires multiple teams who haven’t worked together before\\nAt WP Engine we’re extremely collaborative across teams. The benefit is that we work together for a common goal, taking care of the needs of support, sales, marketing, engineering, product, and finance, rather than solving for one department’s goals at the expense of another. But this also can make decisions more difficult, because finding a good solution is complex, often requiring compromise or creativity which requires time to be realized. This effect is amplified if the teams (or team members) haven’t worked together before, and thus have less rapport, common language, and common experience. In that case, give the decision more time to breathe and develop, because really you’re giving people the time to build relationships and discover great solutions, and that in itself is a benefit to them and your organizational intelligence, which is a long-term benefit worth investing in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nActually this isn’t a scorecard, because important decisions aren’t a Cosmo Quiz. Don’t use this as a rubric; don’t score it 1-5 and add it up with a spreadsheet.\\nRather, honestly answer these questions, and by the time you’re through, you’ll have a good sense of whether a light touch, quick decision is fine (which is the default answer), or whether you should take more time.\\nAnd, depending on which pieces are problematic, you’ll have a guide for what needs to be done next.\\nFor example, if “Can’t undo” is a big problem, can you rethink the solution so that it can be undone, maybe by applying it only in one segment, or investing more time in planning or preparation, or creating a disaster recovery plan, or splitting up the decision so that part of is is undoable?\\nOr if “No compelling event” is a problem, maybe the best answer is to “not decide,” i.e. don’t spend time on this right now, since you don’t have to. Some people will be disappointed in the lack of a decision, but it’s better to honestly state that “we can’t figure out the answer right now” than to make a rash decision that does more harm than good, or to invest time in a decision that doesn’t need to be made, at the expense of work that does need to be done.\\nI hope this helps you make the right decisions, in the right way.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/decisions-fast-slow/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen should a decision be fast, or slow?\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

True wisdom guides you to a better version of yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaiku:\\nWith their eyes of ice\\nhigh-powered executives\\nknow better than you.\\n\\n\\nI was starry-eyed when Frank showed up 18 months after the birth of my company, Smart Bear. Picture it: Frank was a silver-haired ex-VP-of-Sales for a big, successful company. An IPO had made him comfortably wealthy, and now he wanted to hook up with a promising new startup. With his résumé and enough money that he never had to work again, he could be choosy.\\nAnd he chose little ol’ me!\\nAnd boy did I (think I) needed him. “I’m just a software developer, I don’t know anything about sales” I explained to Gerry , who had already unknowingly cemented himself as my mentor. “I’m just a lowly engineer, ignorant of the mystical voodoo of six-figure purchase orders. I don’t even play golf! Frank has been there.”\\nGerry tried to explain. “There’s no magic to it. I’ve sold companies for $100 million without stepping foot on a golf course. You have a good product, you have some customers, just keep going.”\\nOf course I didn’t listen.\\nSo Frank and I headed down the road to partnership. Frank had lots of ideas that “we have to implement, otherwise no big company will give us money.” For example, we had to change our name. “Smart Bear” sounded to Frank like a dorky one-man shareware site. (Ahem…) We needed something stoic and corporate. His suggestion was “Software Test and Deployment Systems, Inc,” or STDS1 for short. Big companies like acronyms, he explained, as if “big company” is an entity that can express an opinion.\\n\\n1\\n It apparently didn’t occur to him that this acronym is already taken. At least we could have used viral marketing.\\nThere was more: We needed patents (“to keep competitors at bay”), we needed a sales team (“software doesn’t sell itself”), and we needed to lighten up (“I like to knock off early on Fridays”). In fact it seemed I was doing very little right!\\nFortunately Gerry finally got through. “Let me get this straight,” he rightly admonished me for the fourth time, “this guy wants 50% of the company, he wants a salary while you get none, he’s going to work 35 hours a week while you work weekends, he’s not bringing any money to the company, and his big idea about how to get more customers is to change your name to venereal disease?”\\nGerry’s criticism of Frank was harsh—as harsh as Frank’s criticism of me—but Gerry was right and luckily I (finally!) heeded him.\\nTwo weeks later I landed a $50,000 deal with a “big company.” (It was Intuit.) A few years later we were doing millions in revenue with “big companies,” still called Smart Bear, still no patents, still no sales guys. Who knew? (Gerry knew.)2\\n\\n2\\n Editor’s Note: I later sold Smart Bear, and now it’s worth over $2,000,000,000. And still called Smart Bear.\\nYou have to understand though, saying no to Frank was hard. He had the expertise, I didn’t. I was convinced that he was right and I was wrong. If it wasn’t for Gerry’s guidance, I would have gone through with it.\\nSo how do you separate the the good counsel from the bad—the Gerrys from the Franks? Both sounded like advice and criticism, both were experienced, both were strong-willed, and both truly believed in what he was saying.\\nHere are a few things that have helped me filter advice:\\n\\nThe best advice doesn’t come as a barrage of statements but rather from a series of questions, asked by someone playing devil’s advocate. Rarely will an advisor know more than you do about your domain of expertise but that doesn’t mean an outside voice is useless. Pointed questions force you to defend your choices. A healthy debate challenges your assumptions without implying they’re false. New ideas are batted around as a brainstorm rather than handed down as gospel. In my case, Frank presented his view as a series of statements, axioms even; Gerry couched his perspective as pointed questions that required either rebuttal or agreement.In fact, playing devil’s advocate is a great exercise to do periodically anyway. Find an intelligent foe, take her to lunch, and follow Scott Berkun’s advice about Rude Q&A.\\n“This is how it’s done” is almost never a good reason. If the sole basis for the advice is “tradition,” it’s just momentum and you might be right to buck the trend. Example: Smart Bear posts its prices on the Internet rather than negotiating. Enterprise software sales are rarely done that way, but posting your price is honest and makes business sense, so we do it anyway.\\nIt’s easy to cut down ideas; it’s hard to create and execute them. Give me any idea and I can find someone who thinks it’s dumb. So what? “Constructive” criticism means constructing, not just blasting. Look for advice with a clear method for implementation and a clear path for results.\\nDoes the criticizer volunteer a way to measure the success of her new idea? If so, the only reason not to try it is time or money. This is the guiding principle behind our marketing efforts. If not, how will you ever know whether or not it was wise?\\nActively develop a network of trusted advisors. These could be local entrepreneurs, on-line forums, even bloggers you like. Everyone needs a Gerry or two. Advisors won’t always agree with each other of course, but nothing beats running ideas past people you respect and who truly have your interests at heart, even if their advice ends up being wrong.\\n\\nBesides, no one knows what’s right, not even me.\\nSeek advice that helps you become a better version of yourself, not advice that aims to change who you are.\\nBeing yourself is the only thing you’re going to be good at, anyway, which is what will give you the leverage you need to win.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/bad-advice/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDistinguishing constructive criticism from bad business advice\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Moats are the antedote; your strategy must create some.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEconomics is useless for predicting what the market will do tomorrow, but it is prescient at predicting long-term forces that shape entire industries. Business strategists ignore this at their peril.\\nOne of these forces is that industries commoditize: Companies copy the best ideas from each other, whether in features to attract customers or cost-savings to build profits, so they converge to similar products with similar cost structures. Undifferentiated in most dimensions, the flexible dimension is price, and in a real-life Prisoner’s Dilemma, price reduces until profits are driven to zero. It’s great for the consumer—the best products at the lowest prices—but bad for the companies.\\nTo avoid homogenization, a company needs differentiation that others cannot copy. Best is differentiation that customers care about, because that should lead not only to higher prices (because customers cannot get the same value elsewhere) but also greater market share. Second-best is differentiation in cost structure, because this allows the company to convert those savings either into profit (keep in the bank, or distribute by dividend or stock buy-back) or growth (spend in sales, marketing, or new product development).\\nDurable differentiation is rare, especially in the software industry where almost anything can be copied.\\nIt is not even enough to have a competitive advantage; the advantage must also be durable. Snapchat invented the idea of “Stories,” but Facebook and Instagram copied it, so the advantage didn’t convert into market share:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nFacebook doesn’t invent anything; they copy. But there is no “first mover advantage” unless that advantage is also durable, i.e. not easily copy-able by rivals.\\n\\n\\nA taxonomy of moats \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most important thing to me is figuring out how big a moat there is around the business. What I love, of course, is a big castle and a big moat with piranhas and crocodiles.\\n—Warren Buffett\\n\\n\\nDurable advantages are often called “moats,” after Warren. The concept appears everywhere—a characteristic of fundamental truth—for example more recently and famously in Hamilton Helmer’s Seven Powers.\\nJerry Neuman collected, organized, and detailed a terrific taxonomy of moats. Such a reference is useful when analyzing other companies (which moats are they building?) or figuring out which moats are best for your business to construct.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Click to Enlarge)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA real-world example will breath life into these trite bullet points.\\nApplying moats to a commoditized market: Cloud Computing \\nAWS (Amazon Web Services) was the first and is still the largest “cloud computing” provider. Its industry is an archetypical example of a market that commoditizes. Indeed, all computing infrastructure markets that preceded the cloud also commoditized, from individual components (e.g. RAM and disks) to entire physical data centers (with power, internet connectivity, climate-control, and physical security).\\nCloud computing—paying only for what you need, by the hour, by the megabyte, scaling up and down at will—is a discrete leap forward in customer value, but commoditization is inescapable, as every by-the-hour CPU, gigabyte of disk, and gigabyte of network transfer from one vendor is the same as from another. If renting infrastructure is the only strategy, the only dimension remaining to compete on is price, so price falls, and the industry commoditizes.\\nIndeed, that’s exactly what has happened, for example in storage:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nDifferent types of storage have different prices, but each type has identical price across vendors. All prices are low.\\n\\n\\nBut AWS has largely avoided commoditization. The proof is in the market-share and in the profit. Every year since 2014, AWS’s profit has been more than half of Amazon’s entire profit; in 2022 it’s generating $21B of profit at a 30% operating profit margin, and growing:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf it were possible for a competitor to steal business by undercutting prices, they would. Indeed, they have; competitors like Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba charge less for similar service. Google in particular spends billions more dollars per year than they make, plus they have all the requisite “smart people,” but even at scale in 2022, on annual revenues of $20B for their cloud computing services, they’re still losing nearly $4B annually. None of this is hurting AWS’s profits, demonstrating that AWS has not commoditized.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy not? We might expect the answer is “moats,” but what are they?\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nAWS Moats \\nIn 2019, then-CEO of AWS (now-CEO of Amazon) Andy Jassy, on stage in a live interview with the great Kara Swisher, was asked directly: Why hasn’t AWS commoditized? Jassy immediately fired off the moats from their anti-commoditization strategy, annotated here with the bullet points from the taxonomy diagram:\\n\\nInnovates the fastest [Economies of Scale + Willingness to Experiment]\\nJassy says they use their size to fuel more and faster innovation. Specifically, revenue today plus line-of-sight to revenue growth for tomorrow, means it is easy to justify a massive investment in innovation. The platform with the most innovation, will have the best tools for developers, which they believe is the key to winning.\\nBiggest Ecosystem [Complementary Assets]\\nThe biggest vendor will attract the most 3rd-party support, which in turn is vital for developers who must integrate with other tools, especially in the modern world where everything is a SaaS.\\nAdvanced operating maturity [Learning Curve]\\nJassy says, “There is no compression algorithm for experience.” Even Microsoft and Google, throwing billions of dollars and thousands of engineers at the challenges, are not able to overtake AWS.\\n\\nThere’s another moat that Jassy didn’t list, probably because he didn’t want to talk about market-share1, and possibly because it could be interpreted as gently insulting to their customers:\\n\\n1\\n Later in the interview, he refused to answer basic questions about how much market share AWS has, or the relative positions of Microsoft, Google, and Oracle, even under pressure from Kara Swisher, the excellent interviewer. Being the market-leader invites regulation and puts you on the defensive in anti-trust cases, so public companies shy away from such claims; for example Amazon owns 43% of all eCommerce at the time of this writing, but they publicly position themselves as a general “retail” company, so that their share is “only” 6%.\\n\\nBrand of “The Leader” [Brand]\\nThe old adage was “no one was ever fired for picking IBM.” Now that’s true of AWS. The idea is that if you pick the market leader, your career isn’t in jeopardy if it doesn’t go well, because you picked the least-risky choice. Often “the leader” is also “more expensive,” so this is not only good for long-term differentiation, but for profitability.\\n\\nThere’s another moat that is clearly part of every major cloud provider’s strategy; perhaps Jassy didn’t mention it because it’s slightly nefarious, as it involves lock-in:\\n\\nHas the biggest menu of technology to select from [Switching Costs]\\nIf customers only buy commodity services like CPU, RAM, disk, and network, it’s easy for them to leave for a cheaper cloud. So, AWS has created hundreds of “services” covering every imaginable corner in the world of infrastructure: big data storage and retrieval, web analytics engines, AI algorithms, logging, alerting, change-management, source code repositories, network firewalls, and support for dozens of open source software packages, all for rent by the hour or gigabyte. Furthermore, they encourage use of these services by making each one free when each is only lightly used. A software developer who avails herself of this incredible array of services is more productive than a large team of developers would have been ten years ago, however her Faustian bargain is that she gives up her ability to switch to a competitor, which means as her project grows and the pricing tiers kick in, she’s locked in.\\n\\nMoats are integral to strategy \\nMoats don’t appear quickly or by accident; they require consistent investment and prioritization over a course of years. This is exactly what a “strategy” is supposed to organize, and what “just be agile and react to whatever happens” will not. Therefore, a good strategy will have identified one or very few moats that the company will create, and the primary themes of action that will excavate them and fill them with Buffett’s piranhas.\\nThe example of AWS shows that the taxonomy is only a starting point. The details of exactly how one item applies to a specific company are essential. A strategy that states “We will create switching costs” is not a strategy; it is a statement of what you hope will become true, rather than an explanation of how you will cause that to become true. A strategy to intentionally create switching costs looks more like this:\\n\\nObjective \\nCreate permanent customers through high switching-costs, caused by extensive integration with their technology stacks, development workflows, and IT administration.\\nHow \\nMaximize the number of cloud services each customer uses. This, in turn, requires:\\n\\nCreate the most number of services as quickly as possible, so there’s more to integrate with. Must have more than the competition, and a reputation of “innovating faster than anyone else,” to attract customers in the first place, and so that customers don’t look elsewhere if we don’t have their favorite service quite yet.\\nCreate compelling “on-ramps” so that services are actually used (e.g. free tiers, great documentation, pre-integration with other APIs, “bundled offerings” that includes many APIs)\\n\\nConsequences \\n\\nIf we build many services, quickly, some of those services will turn out to be duds, or might be strategic only as a part of the larger offering, not high-growth or even profitable on their own. This is a “cost of doing business” and will not constitute evidence that a team has failed or that the strategy is failing.\\nMany individual services will be commoditized, especially when we’re just reselling existing open-source projects. We still need to create these, because integrating many of them into a single customer project is necessary to fulfill the objective, and customer discovery shows that they specifically want to buy those products from us. Creating genuinely unique services are more valuable and defensible, so we need to do that as well, but they also take 100x more effort.\\nGiven that (1) and (2) demand a large quantity of software, built quickly, this is a costly bet; we require $X billion dollars over three years, plus a scaled-up hiring process.\\n\\n\\nThe moat is named, but also how it will be built, along with second-order consequences (high-cost, and frequent failures of usage or of differentiation on a case-by-case basis) that we not only accept, but expect, in service of the objective of creating that moat. With these details and decisions in place, it is a strategy, not a hope.\\nMake sure your strategy is explicit about which moats are being constructed, and the major multi-year activities required to construct them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/moats/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMoats: Durable competitive advantage\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)A taxonomy of moatsApplying moats to a commoditized market: Cloud ComputingAWS MoatsMoats are integral to strategy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Can you ever measure up? No. But don’t worry, there’s a better answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat makes a Product Manager great? The prolific Shreyas Doshi1 gives us the list of requirements in a tweet-storm:\\n\\n1\\n I highly recommend following @Shreyas, despite the following critique; he is a font of wisdom I have bookmarked and swiped many times.\\n\\nGreat PMs consistently and singularly improve the company’s trajectory.\\nGreat PMs are masters of the art of blending quantitative and qualitative inputs, as warranted by each individual situation.\\nGreat PMs become the worldwide experts in their domain. When new to a domain, great PMs bootstrap this process by seeking the counsel of existing worldwide experts.\\nGreat PMs are diligent about using a variety of user research methods to inform what product to build in the first place.\\nGreat PMs also listen to what isn’t said [by customers] and anticipate where the industry overall is headed when developing their product hypothesis.\\nGreat PMs know that buy-in isn’t enough; you need passion & ownership to build great products. Great PMs facilitate discussions that get the entire team to come up with creative product ideas.\\nGreat PMs understand task leverage and spend the majority of their time on the highest-leverage tasks for the company.\\nGreat PMs, in the rare instances of product failure, improve not just their own approach but they also share the lessons learned with the broader company.\\nGreat PMs are adaptive—they have a wide repertoire [of tools and processes and workflows] that they expertly tweak for each specific team’s needs.\\nGreat PMs are outstanding problem preventers. Great PMs are discerning about which problems to prevent, which problems to solve, and which problems not to solve.\\nGreat PMs edit the company’s product ethos—they identify the unintended flaws in the principles, fix the flawed parts—and only then follow & espouse it.\\nGreat PMs know that career ladders are imperfect proxies: they’re more fixated on tangible competence & impact than on checking off boxes on the ladder.\\nGreat PMs also learn through work projects, but they learn a lot more about their craft in their personal time because of their curiosity & passion for self-improvement.\\nGreat PMs ultimately decide what’s best for users & the business.\\nGreat PMs ensure the product strategy is optimal.\\nGreat PMs work hard but are rarely overwhelmed.\\n\\nHaha, that last one is funny. Don’t be overwhelmed, but also “learn a lot more about your craft in your personal time.”\\nThese recitals always include a little “out,” an opportunity for the writer to wriggle out of responsibility for commanding the impossible. Something like, “The final rule is: You can break any rule, if you know what you’re doing.” In this case, the 31st tweet:\\n\\nNaturally, very few PMs are Great.\\nAnd I don’t know any Great PM who does all of the above, all of the time.\\nThat’s because Great PMs know that these ideas should be viewed as signposts, not as commandments.\\n\\nSo you could be super-human at two dozen different things. Now what?\\nI’ve used the following framework for Product Management at WP Engine to answer this question, so that as a whole team we in fact constitute the mythical omnibus “Great PM,” but we achieve it with a set of great—but plausible—real human beings.\\nThe PM decides what to build \\nThe role and scope of “Product Manager” varies between companies, but the role centers on deciding what to build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking backward, there are inputs to the decision—the long-term vision and strategy, and an intimate and evolving understanding of the customer; these are part of Product Management, because without them we cannot make good decisions.\\nLooking forward there’s the execution of building and delivering to customers, the complexity of engineering execution together with coordinated efforts by marketing, sales, customer service, and external partners to deliver the entire experience to customers; these consequences of the decision are also part of Product Management.\\nYou could argue that this particular break-down is arbitrary, however in my experience this categorization is especially actionable for hiring, careers, and designing the PM organization, and is compatible with other ways2 of decomposing the role.\\n\\n2\\n Product thinkers categorize PM roles in myriad combinations. Lenny Rachistky in a podcast says it’s three things: (a) Shape the Product, (b) Ship the Product, (c) Synchronize the people. Later in the same podcast he says it’s five skill areas: (1) Execution, (2) Collaboration, (3) Leadership, (4) Vision + Strategy, (5) User Research. In another blog post he lists the ten jobs of Product Management. You’ll find the four areas below align with any of these break-downs; while all paths arrive at the same destination, I find this one particularly useful in working with real-world people.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nThe four roles of Product Management \\n\\nStrategist\\nAnalyzing, crafting, communicating, and updating the answer to the question: How do we apply our durable advantages to the opportunities in the market, to win? What do we look like in the success-case, years from now? What are the most important challenges to achieving that? Specifically what must we do in the coming years to overcome those challenges? Competitive analysis, market analysis, customer analysis. Determining the few, key personas to focus on. Distilling noisy data into clear identifications of internal strengths, external challenges, and market opportunities. Positioning the product to maximize value and perceived value, and thus price and willingness-to-pay. Selecting the right high-level metrics to drive the right long-term results, while also acknowledging that not all important things are numbers, and that revenue and retention are outputs of great strategy plus great execution, not themselves a strategy or even an operational goal. Having the fortitude to make decisions that will affect us for years, and cause us to say “no” to 90% of our ideas, so we say “yes” to exactly the right ideas.\\nCustomer Whisperer\\nNot just listening to customers, hearing them, understanding their underlying needs, motivations, even their emotions. Not order-taking the features they know how to name, but rooting out the things they worry about so much they would pay to decrease the worry, or figuring out the result they need to get to earn a promotion or achieve their ultimate goal, as opposed to just “features.” More than figuring it out, wanting to figure it out. Having the “taste” to sense what features would be especially useful even in the absence of clear quantitative data, or the nuance that separates a serviceable UX from a delightful one that causes an NPS-10 customer to actually “Promote” in real life. Translating these insights into tangible feature ideas or use-cases of things to build that make the customer a hero.\\nScrum Product Owner\\nAn unfortunately ambiguous phrase for the uninitiated, the Scrum “Product Owner” owns the work-backlog, and works with engineering to execute it. Owning the work from start to finish, breaking down epics into stories, prioritizing and scheduling innovations for customers against engineering demands against requests from other teams against the broader needs of the company. Working tightly with engineering not just to shake them upside down until estimates fall out of their pockets, but working together to solve the puzzles of “most value (whatever that means) in the least time (or risk),” together finding the 80% solution that will take 20% of the time, so that we deliver quickly and learn quickly. Using the tools of story points and velocity and retros for team-wide constructive introspection and improvement, fulfilling the responsible aspect of being “self-managed.” Stretching to maximize how much we deliver, but practical and celebratory so that constant striving doesn’t turn into death-march burn-out. Being in command of the product and team.\\nOrchestrator\\nDelivering the “Whole Product,” as Geoffrey Moore defines it, means not delivering working code only, but also enabling others: Marketing to grab attention and spark curiosity, sales to convert potential energy (leads) into kinetic energy (sales), customer service to shepherd the customer through good times and bad, enabling the Marcomm teams for PR and events, and external integrators and consultants who operate on behalf of clients. Tracking and communicating status, the good news and the challenges, celebrating the wins and facing the challenges with crisp articulation, calming stakeholders in the knowledge that the team is fully aware of what they need to overcome, and thus in command even in dire situations. Running great meetings—starting with a clear goal and how the discussion will support the strategy, tight agendas so participants come prepared and use synchronous time wisely, with decisions made and recorded. Engaging the whole company on occasion, with inspiring presentations at all-hands meetings so everyone is excited about we’re accomplishing together, and so that the teams working directly on the product feel proud, and feel seen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe conclusion is not that “a Great PM must be the master of all this.”\\nIn fact, exactly the opposite.\\nOne excellent, one good \\nIn my experience, echoed by a few people I’ve chatted with, there is a general rule of thumb vis-a-vis the categories of work above:\\n\\nA “Great PM” is\\nexcellent in one area,\\ngood in at least one other,\\nand doesn’t have time for more than two.\\n\\nUsing “Great PM” language, you should strive to be “Great,” as superlative as possible, in one of those four areas, and pretty darn good at a second.\\nI find this particular categorization of four job-areas aligns well to strengths and abilities of real people. Whatever you ascribe to nature or nurture, instinct or experience, for each of those job-areas I can immediately recall specific people who are excellent at nearly all components within a single area, but variously good or lacking in components of a second, and then completely the wrong temperament or lack of desire to excel in others. These four “buckets” seem to me to be natural divisions of ability and proclivity.\\nI don’t believe in magical unicorns who are excellent in all four areas3. But suppose they do exist, and you hired them. Would it be physically possible to execute well in all four areas? It’s easy to see that it’s impossible, if you add up the time it takes to do great work.\\n\\n3\\n Perhaps there are, but the probability that you’ll find one, or hire one, or build a whole organization of them, is near-nil, although you will surely find a lot of candidates who imagine themselves to be one.\\nStrategy is on-going—markets change, competitors change, customers change, new data comes to light (usually only after expending considerable time acquiring it), and whenever you’re “pencils down” on one iteration of a strategy, there are always eight more things you still haven’t figured out yet. Customer discovery takes a long time—scheduling and running interviews, compiling results, mapping what you heard, prioritizing activities or opportunities or use-cases (depending on your frameworks), trying to (in)validate assumptions with data. Being a Product Owner takes at least twenty hours per week to write great stories and run Scrum ceremonies. Anyone who has program-managed multiple teams across multiple departments knows that scheduling and organizing and cajoling and status-updating and data-gathering and meeting-preparation takes a lot of time. Even with sensational skills, no one has time to do it all (with excellence).\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are not going to breed a new race of super-humans; we will have to run our organizations with the humans we have.\\n—Peter Drucker\\n\\n\\nWhile one person cannot be all things to all people, across the entire product team, you do need excellence in all four areas. Thus the manager of a Product organization isn’t simply a “manager,” but rather an “organization designer,” choreographing this outcome through intentional hiring.\\nYou’ll often find these roles in titles other than “Product Manager.” Communications and collaboration is often done by a Program Manager—a role where if you think it’s not useful, it might be because you haven’t worked with someone who is great. Marketing, sales, and support enablement is often done by Product Marketing (i.e. somewhere under the CMO rather than somewhere under the CTO). With highly technical back-end teams with little or no customer exposure, a sociable engineer or architect can be the perfect Product Owner. Mature organizations might have UX Research teams who are expert in customer analysis—building data-based personas, crafting interviews, compiling results, and pooling insights across multiple product teams who happen to share customers.\\nAs the organization designer, your job is to “assemble excellence” in all areas. Even incremental improvements here can be impactful, because so often organizations have excellence nowhere. 95% of employees complain they don’t understand the strategy, or don’t know their role in it; founders-in-PM-roles often run on instinct more than systematic customer analysis; engineering teams often complain of underspecified or under-explained stories; engineers are often surprised at the gulf between what they know to be true about the product and what Sales claims on the phone, just as customer service folks are often surprised at the gulf between what they know to be true about the product, and what engineering thinks is “a job well done.”\\nRather than unicorn-hunting, take this more practical route in your career, or in designing your team.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/great-product-manager/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe “Great” Product Manager, a.k.a. the Impossible Product Manager\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)The PM decides what to buildThe four roles of Product ManagementOne excellent, one good\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

The few things that don’t, are its essence. The voyage is meaningless, unless you decide what those things are.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalm your frenetic TL;DR twitchy-Twitter-brain for five minutes, and let some Chinese philosophy wash over you.\\n\\nThirty spokes join in one hub\\nIn its emptiness, there is the function of a vehicle\\nMix clay to create a container\\nIn its emptiness, there is the function of a container\\nCut open doors and windows to create a room\\nIn its emptiness, there is the function of a room\\nTherefore, that which exists is used to create benefit\\nThat which is empty is used to create functionality\\n—Lao Tzu, Chapter 11, Tao Te Ching, ~600 BCE, translation by Derek Lin\\n\\nAn ancient brainteaser asks: If a wooden ship sails around the world, but along the way each board rots and is replaced by new boards, so that by the end of its journey every board has been replaced, is it still the same ship? Did “it” really go around the world?\\nLao Tzu suggests the answer is “yes,” because the functionality of the ship—the “emptiness” created by those boards—is the essence of the ship.\\nWhat about yourself? Your boards are being replaced every second—trillions of cells splitting, growing, dying. Are you the same person you were ten years ago? Physically, not really. In DNA yes (mostly), but identical twins share DNA and are not the same person. Can you articulate precisely what resides in the emptiness created by your body, or by the electro-chemical pandemonium sloshing within your skull?\\nWhat about a startup? It’s not a person but composed of people. Is a company of 2 people and 150 customers the “same company” as with 150 people and 25,000 customers? In tangible ways it’s not the same, but in its emptiness lies the essence and purpose of this motley crew of human beings.\\nSo the interesting question for a startup is: What is constant? What doesn’t change as we grow, and thus what binds us together in this journey? If we “go around the world,” changing out every board, what has been conveyed?\\nCan’t be about product features, they change, grow, and die like cells. Can’t be about marketing prose, that’s molded by A/B testing into market-resonance. Can’t be people—the team’s composition changes, and those who stay for the entire voyage themselves change. Can’t be the metrics, they’ll change by orders of magnitude. Can’t be the logo, or even the name. Can’t be the office space—Lao Tzu already made that clear, as did COVID.\\nSo, what doesn’t change? Whatever it is, that is what defines the startup and it’s purpose, and is the answer to the all-important question: Why should anyone—employees and customers alike—join the founder on this journey, sharing this very personal responsibility?\\nAt WP Engine we call these constants our “values”—our inviolable constitution. When we need to make a tough decision, our values determine the outcome. For example, if in some choice we must either lose money or do what’s right for the customer, we will do what’s right for the customer. Or if we have to decide whether to fire someone who is exceptionally skillful at his job but is dishonest or works for himself instead of for the team, we will always fire that person.\\nIn fact, a clear agreement of core values is how you empower everyone in the company to act like an owner. Can someone in their first week of tech support decide whether it’s OK to give a customer a large refund or spend extra hours to go above and beyond to fix something? If you have a framework of values which clearly points to that as the right course of action, then someone can make that decision without approval-chains and meetings and debates. Isn’t that the definition of empowerment? And doesn’t that sound like part of the solution to “scale?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSigning the WP Engine values\\n\\n\\nThis is why it’s so important to encode your company’s values on paper. For us, we literally put them on the wall and we all signed it like the US Declaration of Independence. You have to ensure everyone not only agrees to them as a condition of employment, committing them to memory due to external requirement, but because in their bones they already embody those values, and therefore will naturally continue propagating them to those around them and those who follow.\\n“Company Culture” is the output of living your values. It’s never perfect, either as individuals or an organization, and at any given time you’re falling short at some aspects of the culture, aspirationally trying to live up to your own expectations. That’s healthy.\\nThe three companies I founded before WP Engine were successful enough, but I never thought about culture or values. That was a mistake. Today two of those companies still exist, and after nearly two decades have continued to grow, and yet, without a higher purpose, a truly important mission for our customers and dedication to our employees, maybe who cares?\\nWhy so dismissive of that success? Because what sort of jobs did that create? Were people happy and empowered? Mentoring and being mentored? Did they build a career they’re proud of? Did they feel that this time in their life was not wasted?\\nI don’t actually know, how sad is that? Financial success is the means, not the ends. Without financial success the company isn’t sustainable, so that component of success is absolutely necessary.

Ignore this at your peril.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStartups must leverage their specific advantages they have over incumbents to overcome the massive barriers erected by those incumbents: Mature products, mature distribution channels, brand, trust, optimized organizations, and cash in the bank.\\nHowever, in the AI revolution many of those advantages are unavailable. Some even become a disadvantage. This is substantively different from the other two major technological revolutions of the past twenty-five years1.\\n\\n1\\n The Internet and mobile devices. Not blockchain, at least not yet—that has had almost no effect on businesses despite the application of billions of dollars over more than a decade.\\nSpecifically:\\n\\nDisruption Theory & risk-aversion don’t apply\\nIncumbents typically cede market space to startups wherever there’s new, unproven technology or a new, unproven market, especially in spaces where they can’t use past data to predict the future. But in AI, they’re rushing to embrace new technology and uncertain markets, spending historic amounts of money and time.\\nIncumbents aren’t failing to innovate\\nTypically the race is “whether the startup gets distribution before the incumbent gets innovation (Alex Rampell).” But in AI, the incumbents already have the innovation (whether through closed APIs or open source), while startups struggle as mightily as ever to find distribution. Perhaps an even greater struggle, as every market is over-saturated with new startup competitors, some with massive funding.\\nIncumbents have the data\\n“There’s no AI strategy without a data strategy,” the (now often-repeated) saying goes. For training, testing, benchmarking, and features, you need data. Incumbents have it or can afford it; startups are at another disadvantage.\\nGreat talent are happy at incumbents\\nWhile there will always be fantastic people who only want to be at a small company, there are even more people, including are the top AI and software engineering talent in the world, who are getting paid above-market rates to work on the most exciting projects, with healthy budgets, with data to leverage, and with the ability to impact huge numbers of customers quickly without having to do marketing, sales, support, or accounting.\\nThe so-called “AI market” is not what you think it is\\nPeople say “the AI market will be trillions of dollars so there’s enough for everyone,” but there’s no such thing as “the AI market” unless you’re competing directly with OpenAI. The market for chatbots and SEO tools is the same market as before, now with stiffer competition.\\n\\nThe typical startup strategies are wrong because typical strategies rely on the typical advantages of David against Goliath, which are largely untrue in AI. If strategy is “how we will win,” then the “how” must be different with AI.\\nFew AI startups have embraced this reality, and most will fail as a result. It is easy to create an AI startup, gain attention, and generate excitement, but it is much more challenging to compete and win.\\nThe remainder of the article details and defends this case.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisruption Theory does not apply to AI \\nThe Innovator’s Dilemma is not a dilemma this time around.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisruption Theory explains how little upstarts leverage new technology to topple incumbents, even though the incumbents see it coming and act in their rational self-interest.\\nThe theory goes: New technology is often (a) better in some ways, (b) worse in some ways, and (c) cheaper than existing technology. The combination of (a) and (c) can overcome (b). The classic example given in the book is the original transistor radio, whose the sound quality was far worse than the incumbent, beautiful-to-look-at, rich-sounding, furniture-sized-and-weight RCA radios. However, the advantage of the transistor radio is that it is portable, a feature made possible because transistors use so little energy. A radio at the beach that’s staticky and a tinny is a lot better than not having a radio at all. So, upstarts were able to sell radios that were worse in a very important way, but also cheaper and with the advantage of mobility.\\nOf course, over time, the transistor radio improved its sound quality, and this is the other factor in Disruption Theory: The technology that starts out worse becomes better over time, and yet is still cheaper and retains its positive qualities. Then the new technology fully disrupts the incumbents, who had been looking on, thinking “we’re the ones who have great sound, so we’re safe. We’re not even really competing with those toy radios.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nDisruptions start “worse,” but then become even better than incumbents\\n\\n\\nIn AI, the conditions of Disruption Theory are not present.\\nThe incumbents do not look at AI and say “this technology is cheaper but worse, so we will ignore it.” They’re doing just the opposite. They say “this technology is groundbreaking and if we don’t embrace it, we will become irrelevant” and “our shareholders are demanding that we invest huge percentages of our annual revenue to do it.”\\nTherefore, startups who normally depend on incumbents ignoring new technology and new markets, cannot depend on that in AI, and therefore are competing directly with well-funded incumbents who are selling to their existing customer bases.\\nDifferentiation when everyone has the same technology \\nThe “hard tech” in AI are the LLMs available for rent from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and others, or available as open source with Llama, Bloom, Mistral and others.\\nThe hard-tech is a level playing field; startups do not have an advantage over incumbents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere can be differentiation in prompt engineering, problem break-down, use of vector databases, and more. However, this isn’t something where startups have an edge, such as being willing to take more risks or be more creative. At best, it is neutral; certainly not an advantage.\\nIn a market where everyone has access to the same core technologies, simply matching the capabilities of established players is not a winning strategy. This doesn’t mean it’s impossible for a startup to succeed; surely many will. It means that you need a strategy that creates differentiation and distribution, even more quickly and dramatically than is normally required.\\nThere is no AI Strategy without a Data Strategy \\nTraining AI models requires data. Whether you’re training existing models, developing models from scratch, or simply testing theories, high-quality data is crucial.\\nIncumbents have the data because they have the customers. They can immediately leverage customers’ data to train models and tune algorithms, so long as they maintain secrecy and privacy.\\nFor instance, Intercom’s AI strategy is built on the foundation of hundreds of millions of customer interactions. This gives them an advantage over a newcomer developing a chatbot from scratch. Similarly, Google has an advantage in AI video because they own the entire YouTube library. GitHub has an advantage with Copilot because they trained their AI on their vast code repository (including changes, with human-written explanations of the changes).\\nIncumbents can also afford to pay for data:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI will continue to become cheaper, better, and faster in the next few years. Getting access to huge amounts of training data will not; in fact, just the opposite as the companies who possess that data have already learned how valuable it is.\\nGreat talent are happy working at incumbents \\nTraditionally, startups have attracted dynamic and innovative talent with promises of autonomy and wealth potential, outshining rigid incumbents.\\nHowever, the landscape shifts when it comes to AI. While there will always be individuals preferring the startup environment, the allure of working on AI at an incumbent is equally strong for many, especially pure computer and data scientsts who, more than anything else, want to work on interesting AI projects. They get to work in the code, with a large budget, with all the data, with above-market compensation, and a built-in large customer base that will enjoy the fruits of their labor, all without having to do sales, marketing, tech support, accounting, raising money, or anything else that isn’t the pure joy of writing interesting code. This is heaven for many.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany people want to create or join a startup of course. But startups don’t have an inherent advantage for attracting talent; at best this is neutral again.\\nThe “market” is not what you think: AI is not a large, growing market \\n“AI will be a multi-trillion-dollar market” people say. AI is surely the definition of a large, growing market, with many orders of magnitude of growth in its future. Which means it’s perfect for startups.\\nExcept these are nonsense statements. A “market” is a set of buyers, with sufficiently similar needs, constraints, and goals, that the same product can be sold to all of them. The “AI” market consist of companies like OpenAI and Cohere, and indeed that is a large and growing market, but unless you’re competing directly with them, you’re not “in the AI market.”\\nA chatbot is in the chatbot market, and an SEO tool is in the SEO market. Adding AI to those tools is obviously a good idea; indeed companies who fail to add AI will likely become irrelevant in the long run. Thus we see that “AI” is a new tool for developing within existing markets, not itself a new market (except for actual hard-tech AI companies).\\nAI is in the solution-space, not the problem-space, as we say in product management. The customer problem you’re solving is still the same as ever. The problem a chatbot is solving is the same as ever: Talk to customers 24/7 in any language. AI enables completely new solutions that none of us were imagining a few years ago; that’s what’s so exciting and truly transformative. However, the customer problems remain the same, even though the solutions are different.\\nThat said, AI can reignite growth in existing markets. Companies will pay more for chatbots where the AI is excellent, more support contacts are deferred from reaching a human, more languages are supported, and more kinds of questions can be answered, so existing chatbot customers might pay more, which grows the market. Furthermore, some companies who previously (rightly) saw chatbots as a terrible customer experience, will change their mind with sufficiently good AI, and will enter the chatbot market, which again grows that market.\\nStill, the right way to analyze this is not to say “the AI market is big and growing” but rather: “Here is how AI will transform this existing market.” And then: “Here’s how we fit into that growth.”\\nEven so, it sounds a lot easier for an incumbent with a trusted brand and existing customers and all the data, than for a startup. Not impossible for a startup, again the startup is at a special disadvantage that it doesn’t normally have, especially when the startup is entering a new niche, a new market, or is in a market which is organically large and growing.\\n\\nAI is different from previous technological disruptions. The dynamics between startups and incumbents are fundamentally different, and that means you need a different strategy.\\nIf an AI startup has a strategy that looks like a strategy a non-AI startup had five years ago, that may very well be the wrong strategy.\\nThis doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make an AI-based startup. In fact, all new startups probably do need to include AI.\\nIt means the usual startup strategies might not work, so you need to think deeply and have a different point of view about how you’re going to win.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/ai-startups/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAI startups require new strategies: This time it’s actually different\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Disruption Theory does not apply to AIDifferentiation when everyone has the same technologyThere is no AI Strategy without a Data StrategyGreat talent are happy working at incumbentsThe “market” is not what you think: AI is not a large, growing market\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Bets, experiments, and trials are excellent techniques, but by “investment” I mean a big commitment (time, money, reputation, opportunity cost), over a long time-frame, with a large potential payoff, under conditions of uncertainty.\\nTackling this combination of constraints leads to a framework for evaluating which investments are worthwhile.\\nDon’t use “Expected Value” \\nEconomics instructs us to use “expected value” to evaluate investments. This is almost always the wrong tool for the job.\\nThe theory appears sound: “Expected value” means multiplying the value of the outcome by the probability of attaining that outcome, resulting in a single number that encompasses both risk and value; a “risk-adjusted value,” as they say in finance.\\nLet’s take an example to see why this number isn’t useful for evaluating investments.\\nInvestment “A” requires you to spend $50,000, and takes an entire year of your life. The payoff is $1,000,000. Furthermore, the probability of payoff is 100%—it’s a signed contract with cash in an escrow account. Therefore, the “expected value” is $1M1, and the return on our investment is 20x2.\\nGreat investment! Now consider investment “B”—you also spend $50,000 and a year of your life, and this time the payoff is a whopping $10M, but the probability of that payoff is only 10%. The other 90% of the time, you receive no money at all. The “expected value” is also $1M3, the same as investment A. And therefore investment B is also a 20x payoff.\\n\\n1\\n Because 100%\\xa0×\\xa0$1M\\xa0=\\xa0$1M\\n2\\n Because the $1M expected value is 20 times the cost of $50k.\\n3\\n Because (10%\\xa0×\\xa0$10M)\\xa0+\\xa0(90%\\xa0×\\xa0$0)\\xa0=\\xa0$1M\\nPerhaps you already see the flaw in the logic. With investment B we will almost certainly lose money and lose a year of our life, yet we’re still claiming it represents a “20x payoff.” We’re also claiming that B is economically indistinguishable from A.\\nBut unless you already have many millions of dollars in the bank, you probably wouldn’t pick investment B, because investment A is a guaranteed life-changing amount of money, while B is almost certainly a waste of a year and $50k. They are not even remotely equivalent.\\nIt’s even worse in real life because you rarely know either number—neither the risk nor the payoff. Whether it’s the stock market, a startup, or whether a certain career path will still be lucrative in ten years, even experts can’t predict probability or outcome. So, what garbage numbers are you multiplying together to get “expected value,” and isn’t the result even worse garbage?\\nThere is one case where expected value is the right tool: A portfolio of bets. When a VC invests in twenty companies, when you write 100 newsletters and 1000 tweets, when you play 1000 hands of poker, when you have a balanced, uncorrelated financial portfolio, then you’ll have some winners and some losers, and they roughly balance out, and therefore an “average” like expected value is indeed what you should expect. This relative stability in outcome is why a portfolio of asymmetric bets is a good strategy. The types of investments covered in this article aren’t like that—e.g. what job to take next, what startup you’re going to spend your savings on—but if you can place a number of uncorrelated4 bets, then expected value becomes useful.\\n\\n4\\n Correlation is a key factor which often brings down portfolios, including angel, VC, and financial. “Correlation” means “as goes one, so very likely goes the other.” In that case, you’re back to the original scenario. Only if they are independent—like successive coin flips—can you employ “the average” to determine the likely total result.\\nMandate an outsized payoff \\nIn the success case, the investment must have an enormous payoff.\\nIf the payoff isn’t huge, then it’s not worth the (unknown!) risk. Not just the risk that it pays off at all, but the magnitude of the payoff. When it can pay off 10x or 100x, or when it can be life-altering, then even if you fall short of the goal—only 3x or only life-improving—then it was still worthwhile.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn’t be riskier.\\n—Howard Marks\\n\\n\\nHow do you define “enormous?” How can you calculate the payoff, especially with things like career paths?\\nUse Fermi estimation. As I also suggest for ROI calculations, probabilities, and evaluating markets, estimate to the nearest power of ten. Estimation in detail is difficult and often incorrect; estimating to the nearest power of ten is easy, often requiring little research.\\nFor example, if one career path means earning 50% more per year for ten years (after you get established), that’s 10x more earning power over your career. Or a startup targeting a small, stagnant niche might someday be worth $1M, whereas a small software company in a larger, growing space could be worth $10M.\\nYou’ll be tempted to round up; in fact I just did in the “50% more earning power” example. Don’t do that, because you’re exaggerating how good the investment is; typically if there’s any error, it’s in the direction of being less valuable. If, for example, your main career goal is to maximize your earning power, then “50% more” is not good enough; you need to find a different route that potentially doubles your current trajectory5.\\n\\n5\\n 2x more for 10 years is actually 20x of course, but now rounding down to 10x makes sense, especially since it might not be 2x exactly and it might take a few years to ramp up.\\nThis is the same logic as selecting Rocks in the Rocks, Pebbles, Sand prioritization framework. Your large personal investments are Rocks, and must be evaluated accordingly.\\nAccumulate value over time \\nFor the payoff to be large, value needs to accumulate, which means it needs to be possible to add value reliably, and for value-already-added to not erode quickly. At a minimum, value must accrete, but ideally you construct a positive feedback loop, where growth or size itself begets more growth.\\nSocial media and SEO are like this—the more you write, the more others interact with you, the more others link to you, the more attention you get, the more traffic you get, which makes it easier to get more attention and interactions. Writing consistently increases your ability to write well and often, and thus there is a positive feedback loop of growth and value.\\nProduct companies are like this, especially with the recurring-revenue business model, where the revenue grows so long as each months there are more customers starting o use the product as there are stopping, which will happen so long as you’re making a product that people truly want and love. (Here’s my roadmap to Product/Market Fit for how to build such a company.)\\nConsulting and professional services companies are often not like this. You’ll have regular customers, but the reason consulting companies and accounting and law firms are often valued around 1x revenue or less, while SaaS companies with similar growth-rate are valued at 5x − 10x revenue, is because the work you do for a client isn’t accumulating and applying automatically to all other clients, and consulting companies are hard to scale.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\\n—Albert Einstein.\\n\\n\\nSome people insist that investments must be exponential, but often they don’t understand what that means, believing for example that “viral products” are exponential, when in fact they are not. Exponential is wonderful of course, but not required, and in fact is probably a red herring for most ventures.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nStable success conditions over ten years \\nJust because the world values something today, doesn’t mean it will be valued ten years from now. If you spend 3-5 years investing, expecting a payoff in the subsequent 5 years, the world had better still value that thing during years 5-10.\\nThis summarizes Jeff Bezos’s famous explanation of why Amazon’s strategy has always been based on “what will not change.” He articulates it so well, I’ll leave it here without further commentary (except my emphasis, in bold):\\n\\nI very frequently get the question: “What’s going to change in the next 10 years?” And that is a very interesting question; it’s a very common one. I almost never get the question: “What’s not going to change in the next 10 years?” And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two—because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. … [I]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that’s going to be true ten years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection.\\nIt’s impossible to imagine a future ten years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff, I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher.” “I love Amazon; I just wish you’d deliver a little more slowly.” Impossible.\\nAnd so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.\\n—Jeff Bezos, 2012 (it’s been 10 years since this quote, so we can confirm this was indeed the correct analysis.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlign with global trends \\nIf the best investment is in something that doesn’t change, the next best is aligned with a global trend with sufficient momentum that it is unlikely to change soon, if ever.\\nFor a startup, you want to be in a large, growing market. This maximizes the number of niches you might find traction in, without triggering a reaction from a large incumbent. It maximizes the number of marketing channels you might be able to leverage. It means people are already spending money, so you’re answering “why buy from me” rather than “why should I allocate budget for this at all” or arguing against “that’s a problem but not a priority” or evangelizing against “I never heard of that problem.” It means the pie is growing, even if your percentage of the pie is small.\\nOther current trends are the increase in virtual and distributed workforces, the increasing average age of humans on Earth, the increase in physical delivery services and online shopping, the increasing global demand for health care, education, and energy, and of course the rise of AI in unlocking novel features and capabilities for products and services that are changing the nature of work and life.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\\n—Warren Buffett.\\n\\n\\nA trend you can depend on is either (a) so large today that it would take a decade to change significantly, or (b) is growing so fast (e.g. at least 5x in next 5 years) that it will be a strong trend even if your growth estimate is significantly wrong.\\nHave an “edge” \\nWhy should you make this investment, not someone else? A good investment, that you cannot execute with excellence, isn’t a good investment for you.\\nWhat’s your edge?\\nIn financial or startup investing, the edge is often your ability to evaluate the risk. You might understand that a certain execution in a certain product in a certain market carries lower risk than others believe. This is an edge, though it is a rare one, in part because even experts are bad at evaluating risk (and the majority of VC funds lose money, and Angel investors are even worse).\\nMore likely it’s something special about your execution. I’m avoiding the word “unique,” because although it’s great if you’re truly unique in some way, this is rare, and in fact unnecessary. You should, however, leverage your strengths so that you have an edge, despite also being worse in most other areas.\\nOne way to be special is to be the top 0.1% in the world at something (e.g. Olympic athlete), but that’s probably not what you are. The other way, and the way available to all of us, is to be in the top 25% at a few uncorrelated6 things, which together creates a special edge.\\nThe quintessential exponent of this idea is Scott Adams, writer of the Dilbert cartoon and now political activist, who points out that he is a decent illustrator but not great, a decent humorist but worse than any comedian on Netflix, and has held jobs in the tech sector, which almost no artist or comedian has done, and therefore it is at the intersection of those three “circles of competence” that he has something unique to give to the world.\\n\\n6\\n For example, being great at both math and computer programming doesn’t make you any more special, because those often occur together, whereas being artistic and great at programming places you in a much more elite group.\\n“Passion” can be part of an edge, but it is not enough. Passion creates motivation, which is especially important when you have to push through the difficult times and persevere. However, having passion doesn’t mean the risk is low, the payoff is high, the market is good, the customers are there, the product is desirable, or the career is lucrative.\\nHaving an edge reduces risk while increasing not only the potential size of the payoff, but your own personal fulfillment, because it puts you at the center of what you love, what you’re good at, and what the investment needs to be successful.\\nAlign with your long-term vision \\nIf you run quickly in the wrong direction, that’s not progress.\\nIf you make investments that pay off, but the pay-off isn’t what will make you proud, or happy, or fulfilled, or rich, or whatever your goals are, then it’s not a good investment.\\nIf you don’t have a long-term vision for yourself, consider making one. Taylor Pearson has some great advice on how to make a vision and how to set short-term goals against it. See also the last section of my article on fulfillment, with a series of questions that help you discover what you love and hate.\\nIn much of my life, I haven’t had a vision. Fortunately, my path has largely been in the right direction anyway, but I wonder how much of that is due to luck.\\nBest not to leave it to luck.\\nGood investments are rare \\nWith all these restrictions and rules, it’s hard to find a good investment!\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven our size, we see few good things [to invest in]. If we were smaller, then we’d see lots of good things.\\n—Warren Buffett.\\n\\n\\nYup. Most startups fail. Most VC portfolios lose money. 80% of day-traders lose money.\\nThat’s why it’s so important to adhere to these guidelines—because most investments aren’t right for you, and you don’t want to spend the next five years doing the wrong thing.\\nOf course you’ll never know if you made the best choice, even with hindsight. So the goal isn’t to make the “best choice,” but rather to make an excellent choice. To invest wisely, with the information you have.\\nGood luck!\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/investment/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDeciding whether an investment is worthwhile\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Don’t use “Expected Value”Mandate an outsized payoffAccumulate value over timeStable success conditions over ten yearsAlign with global trendsHave an “edge”Align with your long-term visionGood investments are rare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

In practice we’re not always so understanding when it comes to our teams, our revenue targets, and especially when it comes to flogging ourselves.\\nIndeed, not all errors signify progress. Some are negligence, or just bad luck. We don’t always learn from failure; in fact, sometimes there’s nothing in particular to learn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following “errors” are the natural by-product of good decisions, or the result of a fundamentally positive circumstance that is attended by the proverbial “good problem to have.” Most demand a response, but they should be regarded as a necessary side-effect of success, and celebrated as such.\\nRe-adding features/bugs you removed from the backlog \\nIf you’re not adding back feature-requests or bugs you cleaned out of the backlog, you’re not cleaning out enough.\\nBacklogs grow without bound unless they are culled. 1000 tickets is the same as 100 tickets, except that you haven’t identified which 10% are most important. Which means you’re definitely not working on the most important ones. But if you delete things, it will sometimes turn out we needed to do it after all. That’s a sign that you’re handling your backlog well. (In part for this reason, you should have multiple backlogs, except for the work you’re doing right now.)\\nPivoting a strategy just after creating it \\nA strategy that never changes is wrong, and the most likely time to discover that it’s wrong is just after you wrote it down, because you have the least practical experience with how it intersects with real life.\\nIf you’re not pivoting a strategy that turned out to be wrong, you’re penalizing the company with months or even years of useless work, followed by rework (if you haven’t run the company into the ground), putting the entire future of the company at risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat strategies are hard to create, and released with great fanfare: Sparkling documents, inspiring presentations, pulpit-thumping speeches, reorganized teams and strategic-pillarized work. So the last thing you want, is come back in a month and say, “just kidding, we were wrong about something important.”\\nWill you lose credibility? Will anyone believe the new strategy? Will people think “management doesn’t know what it’s doing?” These are risks you have to take, because executing the wrong strategy is far worse. Indeed, this is the expected result of a new strategy; it’s highly unlikely you got everything right the first time. The best way to communicate, is to say everything in this paragraph out loud, so everyone knows that you know that they know, and that you’re putting the company first, and ensuring that no one is doing work that we secretly know is the wrong work.\\nRefactoring infrastructure after growing 10x \\nIf you’re not refactoring your infrastructure after a tenfold increase in growth, you over-engineered your original infrastructure.\\nHaving scaled WP Engine to millions of websites serving tens of billions of requests daily, I can tell you that scale is hard, and that you don’t know what will break under scale until you’re already scaling (because you have to handle things that you can’t even measure yet). If you over-engineer your original product, you’re simply not shipping your SLC fast enough, and your naïve attempt at engineering massive scale from the start is just another form of premature optimization.\\nAdding words because messaging was too terse \\nIf you’re not adding back words because the messaging was so terse that it became confusing, your marketing is too verbose, too fluffy, and probably doesn’t know what it’s trying to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople don’t read. Tweets are short. Google Ads are shorter. Email titles are shorter. People bounce off home pages in three seconds. No one reads the paragraph of text in the dialog box. It’s 100x more likely that your messages aren’t punchy enough, aren’t specific enough, than that they’re so brief as to be unintelligible. Nowadays you can use ChatGPT prompts to get you 80% of the way there, so you have no excuse.\\nAdding back features you removed \\nIf you’re not adding back features you removed, you’re not removing enough.\\nMany products never remove features. This indicates we’re not being critical enough, not weeding our garden, not learning what customers really want, not understanding what’s useful, not admitting when we got it wrong, not shifting when the market shifts. When we do remove a feature, sometimes it will turn out the feature really was important after all. While of course in a perfect world we wouldn’t have made that mistake, it’s a natural consequence of weeding.\\nFixing lots of bugs just after a major release \\nIf you’re not fixing bugs due to releasing quickly, you released too late.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile releasing garbage is a bad policy, it’s also bad to wait until “everything’s perfect.” Windows 95 shipped with tens of thousands of known bugs1, and was heralded as one of the greatest software innovations and most successful product releases of its time. Contact with customers lets you know which bugs are more important to fix next, and always reveal new bugs that you weren’t going to find on your own anyway.\\n\\n1\\n There were so many, there’s an entire book explaining how to work around 1000 of them.\\nWaiting too long to scale support or sales \\nIf you held onto support and sales for too long, rather than hiring a team, you learned a lot about your customers, and a lot about how to do Support and Sales.\\nIt’s a classic funded-startup mistake to scale out either of these organizations too soon. Without a system in place, with materials, knowledge bases, and scripts, new hires don’t know how to do the job. A distributed-work environment makes this 10x more challenging. The second you put someone else between you and a customer, your pace of learning and understanding falls off a cliff. Wait until it’s breaking for lack of scale2, then scale.\\n\\n2\\n Once at scale, this rule no longer applies; at that point, you’re mismanaging the company\\nLetting someone go soon after hiring \\nIf you held onto someone even though you knew isn’t was never going to work, you’re doing a great disservice to that person, and your team, and your company, and yourself.\\nOf course this shouldn’t be done capriciously, but no one benefits from dragging it out. One likely outcome is that you lose good people, because they see you building a team they don’t want to be a part of. Another is a deluge of meetings, complaints, side-conversations, and general worsening of morale. And lower productivity, as competent people cover for the incompetent. You have to face the truth and act quickly. If this is happening a lot, it’s also urgent that you fix your hiring process; in the meantime, the rule still applies.\\nIgnoring a competitor’s move that turned out to be important \\nIf you’re not ignoring most of your competitor’s moves, then you’re playing their game, not yours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s essential to stay focused on your unique value proposition and not get sidetracked by every move your competitors make. For instance, when a major competitor of Dropbox launched a similar service at a lower price, Dropbox chose to stay the course, focusing on their superior user experience and brand loyalty, rather than engaging in a price war.\\nSometimes it will turn out that you really do need to react, but that signal will come from customers, in the form of them asking for features “because so-and-so has it” or cancelling and going to a specific competitor. That indeed demands a reaction, but only because you’re seeking what’s genuinely best for your customers, not because you’re reacting to everything that competitors do.\\nRejecting a lucrative, distracting deal \\nIf you’re not rejecting lucrative deals that don’t align with your strategy, then you don’t have a strategy. If you’re not rejecting relationships that don’t align with your core values, you don’t have core values.\\nMoney is too tempting to reject. Money is one of the main reasons you’re building a company in the first place. Money is what keeps the doors from closing and enables the next set of things you want to do. It’s even wise to say “yes” instead of “no,” so long as there’s enough money in it.\\nBut money is not more important than strategy, and it cannot be more important than your values, otherwise you’re saying that you don’t actually have either one. There’s always a way to make more money—a different product, different industry, or breaking the laws or being unethical. There’s a reason why you’re taking the path you’re currently on.\\n\\nNot all problems are bad. It’s easy to be hard on ourselves, but sometimes we should do just the opposite:\\nCelebrate our devotion to good decisions and good strategy, even when it has negative consequences.\\nThat means you have a strategy, and have the ability to make the tough, wise decisions.\\n\\nHT Hassy Veldstra for finding the Staedtler advertisement.\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/good-problems-to-have/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe “errors” that mean you’re doing it right\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Re-adding features/bugs you removed from the backlogPivoting a strategy just after creating itRefactoring infrastructure after growing 10xAdding words because messaging was too terseAdding back features you removedFixing lots of bugs just after a major releaseWaiting too long to scale support or salesLetting someone go soon after hiringIgnoring a competitor’s move that turned out to be importantRejecting a lucrative, distracting deal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

(Hint: Not 10)\\n\\nby Jason Cohen on December 10, 2023\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we happened to evolve with nine fingers, we would have “Top 9” lists. So, a “Top 10” list probably doesn’t have the correct number of things.\\n\\nHow many things should there be on the list?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1: Focus\\nIt’s reductive to say only one thing is important, but it also ensures that it gets done, as quickly as possible.\\n3: Magic Number\\nHumans across the globe have always liked when things come in threes. Also you can remember them all.\\n7: Because 7 ± 2\\nFrom one of the most-cited papers in psychology, seven items is what the average person can keep in their head simultaneously. If you can’t keep it in your head, even when you’re trying very hard, it’s too many items.\\n5: Because with post-COVID brains, now it’s 5 ± 2\\nI have no data to support this claim, but I claim it nonetheless.\\n17: One per team\\nIf you have 17 teams, perhaps you have 17 items. Normally this is too many items, but this is actually a repeat of “1: Focus” at the team level. It’s still arguably too many if people span multiple teams.\\n132: 100% completion\\nIf there are 132 flags in the security audit, you could set a goal to address all of them. Getting through 100% of a specific set of things is a powerful statement. One could call this the same as “1: Focus” but with sub-items, where it’s nice to have a checklist, and nice to feel progress as the team gets through the checklist, and clarity on why there are 132 items specifically, and a clear state-change when the very last item is finished (e.g. “We pass this audit, and then [large customer] renews for three years.”)\\n402,302: Bankruptcy\\nAn inbox with this many unread emails is the same as an inbox with no unread emails, except a number looms over your head. Declare “bankruptcy”—whether it’s the email inbox or the Jira backlog. Archive1 it all. The important things will come back.\\n\\n\\n1\\n “Archive,” rather than “delete,” because disk space is close to free, and if you really needed something after all, you still have it. Not quite Marie Condo.\\nAlways Ask: What is the purpose of this list?\\nGiven its purpose, should there be more things or fewer things? Is there a good reason why this the right number of things?\\nUsually, fewer is better, and the right answer is almost never “10.”\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/top-10/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow many things should there be?

For example, this simple “case study” that I’ve used in sales calls at WP Engine takes less than a minute to tell:\\n\\nOne of our customers is ______. Like you, they are a popular food blogger, making money through advertising and occasional affiliate product sales. One Thanksgiving, on their busiest day of the year, their site crashed because of all the traffic; they missed out on thousands of dollars of revenue and hundreds of newsletter sign-ups. They moved their site to us, and that never happened again; they just focus on their work, build their brand and business, and never worry about technology.\\n\\nIt’s equally effective for presentations, fundraising, and product proposals—a ready-made outline, resulting in a straightforward narrative structure. Our brains are pre-wired for fairy-tales, so we naturally follow the presentation as it flows into those primordial ruts in our gray matter.\\nA less obvious but extremely powerful application of this principle is in creating a strategic plan, i.e. analyzing the current situation and deciding what needs to be done. For a single team, this means being in command of the most critical things that need to be done right now. For a department at a larger company like WP Engine, this is how I build our quarterly strategic plans1.\\n\\n1\\n It looks like I’m just slapping the word “strategic” on everything, to make it sound important. Indeed, people often do that. As you’ll see, the purpose of this is to connect work to the strategy, so it really is strategic planning!\\nOver the past two years, together with a few product teams at WP Engine, we’ve created and honed a simple but effective framework for the Fairytale Plan—strategic work-planning that has worked well both to drive the process of figuring out what the plan should even be, as well as communicating the result throughout the company. The process is akin to the widely-admired Double-Diamond design process, and the final result matches the fairytale structure.\\nNo wonder it works, and resonates with everyone.\\nHere’s how you can do this too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe narrative structure of the strategic Fairytale Plan \\nHere’s how our strategic plan will look, and the guiding questions that help us create each section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategic Plan Narrative\\nGuiding Questions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjectives\\nWe must advance our strategy by achieving these objectives.   Fairytale  1. Once upon a time…  2. Every day…  \\n• What is happening now?  • What do we want?  • What happens if we don’t get it?  •\\xa0If we weren’t encumbered by roadblocks, with no distractions and no interruptions, how would we advance our strategy right now?  \\n\\n\\nObstacles\\nBut obstacles stand in our way.   Fairytale  3. But then, one day…  5. Obstacles2  \\n• What is standing in the way3 of “what we want?”  • What makes it difficult to achieve the objectives?  \\n\\n\\nActions\\nSo here’s what we’re doing.   Fairytale  4. Adventure begins…  5. Tackling obstacles…  \\n• How do we overcome the obstacles…  • …while advancing the objectives?  •\\xa0…with the people and capabilities and strengths we currently have?  •\\xa0What changes need to be made, so that the answer becomes obvious?  \\n\\n\\nMeasures\\nAnd here’s how we’ll know whether we’re making progress, and when we’re finished.   Fairytale  6. Until victory…  7. The world anew.\\n• How will our company be different?  • How will we know, objectively?\\n\\n\\nNot Doing\\nImportant topics and ideas that we’re not doing (yet).\\n•\\xa0What do we really want to do, but have to wait so that even more important or urgent things can be done?  •\\xa0What did we leave out that is contraversial?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n In a fairytale it’s fun to surprise the hero with obstacles. Our plan must do the opposite: Clarify the obstacles up front.\\n3\\n There are many kinds of obstacles: internal execution challenges, interruptions, dependencies, competitive pressure, market dynamics, just to name a few.\\nThere are techniques and pitfalls for each of these sections. Here’s how to navigate it:\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nStrategic Objectives \\n\\nNarrative Plot Point\\nWe must advance our strategy by achieving these objectives.\\nGuiding question\\nIf we weren’t encumbered by roadblocks, with no distractions and no interruptions, how would we advance our strategy right now?\\nWhy can’t we skip this section?\\nIf you don’t know your strategy, if you don’t know how you’ll win, then even if you run very fast, it will be in the wrong direction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjectives shouldn’t summarize the entire strategy; your strategy document already does that. Instead, link to that document for reference, and highlight 1-3 specific objectives as the subset of the strategy that make sense to advance right now.\\n“Right now” is the difference between this plan and your strategy. The strategy is the long-term vision and the main ways that you will achieve it. The plan is where you select the specific next steps that materially advance the strategy while achieving results that you need today. “Results today” is typically revenue growth, cost reduction, or some internal transformation.\\nLater in the process of creating the plan, when you’re determining how to achieve these objectives while also dealing with the obstacles, you might get stuck, unable to invent anything that works. In that case, you might need to choose different objectives. Or you might decide that “eliminating obstacles” is all you can accomplish right now—unfortunate, but useful to declare if true. During the planning process you should expect and even encourage fluidity between exploring the problem-space and solution-space.\\nThe specific objectives will evolve over time, but it’s OK if they’re the same for a few quarters in a row. Indeed, that gives the team stability and focus. How do you know if you’re sticking with an objective for too long? Later you’ll be asking the question “how will the world be different.” If there are good answers, then we’ll know whether we’re making progress, despite the objectives remaining the same.\\nObstacles \\n\\nNarrative Plot Point\\nBut obstacles stand in our way.\\nGuiding question\\nWhat is preventing us from making rapid progress on the objectives?\\nWhy can’t we skip this section?\\nOften the most important business challenges appear here, not in the objectives. This is where you face difficult truths about your current situation, which will ensure the work you select will actually overcome them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.\\n—Albert Einstein.\\n\\n\\nI agree with Einstein (but then, who among us is in a position to argue against Einstein?). This is the most important section, and often where you’ll spend the most time.\\nYou’ll be tempted to ignore Einstein, but it is crucial that you do not. You’ll want to jump right to the solution. You’ll say you’ve already talked about this stuff, and you know what to do. You’ll say you don’t want to rehash all our challenges; let’s cut to the action.\\nI understand, I feel the same way. I want to activate on any reasonably-good idea right away. It’s wrong, because if you’re moving quickly in the wrong direction, you’re not making progress.\\nWithout fully exploring the problem-space, you’re not in a position to even know the goal of the solution-space. You’ll just keep repeating mistakes, keep avoiding the difficult truths, and you won’t improve.\\nIt’s important to generate many options first; only by exploring the whole space will you uncover the things which are the most important to solve now. Your team will thank you for the clarity, not only about what they need to tackle, but what they’re allowed to leave alone, even though it’s on fire.\\nHere are some types of obstacles you should explore, in no particular order:\\n\\nIntrinsic difficulty: “Why is this hard?”\\nExecuting the strategy might be intrinsically difficult, like building something we’ve never built before (thus maximally risky and uncertain), or having to create novel algorithms, or having to deploy infrastructure at scale, or pivots, rewriting, rebranding, or repositioning that will take intense effort and coordination.\\nTeam challenges: Humans are hard.\\nDo we have the right skillsets on the team? The right experience levels? The right motivation? Are they burned-out? Is there enough people to do all the work?\\nCompetitive pressure\\nIs a competitor winning business in a way that demands a response, even if it’s not directly related to our long-term strategy?\\nCustomer retention pressure\\nAre customers leaving at high rates4, and therefore we have to address that immediately even if it’s unrelated to our long-term strategy?\\n\\n\\n4\\n My rule of thumb for “what is a ‘good’ cancellation rate” is: 3%/mo for consumer, 2%/mo for small business, 1%/mo for enterprise. More on that here.\\n\\nInterruptions\\nAre we dealing with interrupt-driven work instead of planned work, such that we’re unable to make enough progress on strategic work? Do we need to do work to reduce the frequency or magnitude of the interruptions, perhaps through automation or rejecting certain types of work?\\nToo many bugs\\nAre we failing on our basic promises to our customers of quality and performance, due to mounting bugs or other issues? Do we need to attack those now, even if they are unrelated to our long-term vision?\\nDependencies / coordination\\nIs it impossible for us to execute or deploy or iterate, due to some other team or process or platform or architecture? Do we need special coordination of work in order to achieve our own goals?\\nProcess bottlenecks\\nAre our tools getting in our own way? Is our process preventing throughput? Not just nice-to-have improvements, but step-changes in our productivity, and likely also our happiness?\\nMarket evolution\\nAre there trends that are making our current product or positioning less effective or less relevant? Does this even mean our strategy needs to change, to keep up with the changing external landscape?\\n\\nNarrow these down to 1-3 most critical issues. The guiding question is: Which are the few issues where, if we solved them or took a huge bite out of them, but allowed all others to fester without any progress whatsoever, we would still consider that to be a victory. Whereas if we allowed those few to go untreated, and completely solved five others, we would still be unable to achieve our strategic objectives?\\nIf that question is still hard to answer, then as a guideline I like the following order of precedence. That is, if you have a serious problem in some of these categories, I generally pick whichever comes first:\\n\\nRetention (if customers are leaving, the business model and product isn’t working)\\nPeople (must have the right team)\\nThroughput (can’t do enough strategic work per month)\\nGrowth (of the things you have direct control over)\\nCompetition\\nHealth of the code base\\nExecution risk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA perfect formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\\n—David Hilbert\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nMain Activities \\n\\nNarrative Plot Point\\nHere’s what we’re doing.\\nGuiding question\\nHow do we overcome or side-step the obstacles, while advancing the strategic objectives, with our current people and capacity?\\nWhy can’t we skip this section?\\nIf you don’t select a few, large, impactful things to do (“Rocks”), you will wile away your time chipping away at incremental things, believing that you’re making progress because you are “agile,” but in fact not tearing down the obstacles nor achieving the objectives quickly enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile putting your finger on the crux of the challenges is often the most emotionally-difficult part, deciding what to do is the most intellectually-difficult. It’s hard to think of great ideas, and no framework or process magically causes you to be creative and insightful.\\nAs with obstacles, you should start in “generation mode,” coming up with as many ideas as possible, before switching into “selection” mode, where you pick which ones to do. You should already have queues of ideas from around the company; if not, now is a good time to create some. If you’re having trouble coming up with creative ideas, use Extreme Brainstorming to shake things up.\\nIf you’re having trouble figuring out how to deal with the obstacles, consider the parable of Herbie (from The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt). A group of hikers are climbing a mountain. One hiker—Herbie—is constantly falling behind, preventing the group from achieving their goal of reaching the summit. There are three ways to deal with Herbie: (1) Kick Herbie off the team; (2) Help Herbie get better; (3) Decide that you’re not going to achieve your goal. These options help you think of solutions; respectively: (1) Let that problem burn or ignore certain work that you’ve assumed “needs” to be done; (2) Do work that mitigates the problem; (3) Change your objectives to something you can actually achieve.\\nOften the best solutions come from synthesizing several ideas. For example, often at WP Engine an idea that increases website performance for our customers also decreases our costs, because it takes less CPU time or fewer bytes transferred over the internet to accomplish the same end result. This is another reason to use things like Extreme Brainstorming; even if an individual idea is bonkers, it might be synthesized with a practical idea into a great solution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the final selection process I recommend the Binstack method, because you’re picking one or just a few critical big things to do. Your objectives and obstacles act as natural filters, immediately eliminating anything that doesn’t directly address those, but allowing yourself a few secondary prioritization dimensions.\\nYou might be tempted to use an ROI analysis, but this is the wrong framework. ROI is good for smaller activities, where the goal is to find the “best use of time.” For your most critical pieces of work, the goal is not to optimize your time, but rather to maximize your impact on the most critical things.\\nSee this Rocks, Pebbles, and Sand work-planning framework for a complete system that covers all kinds of work, including these most-critical activities and medium-sized work where ROI analysis is appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\nA successful solution to a problem makes the problem appear to have been nonexistent in the first place.\\n—James Surowiecki\\n\\n\\nMetrics & Indicators \\n\\nNarrative Plot Point\\nHere’s how we’ll know whether we’re making progress, and when we’re finished.\\nGuiding question\\nHow will we know whether it’s working? What is changing? What did we learn?\\nWhy can’t we skip this section?\\nIt’s easier to avoid accountability, believing that hard work and high throughput is the same as having an impact. We must not let ourselves off the hook, but neither should be measure ourselves against metrics we don’t believe in, or insist that all important things can be boiled down to a number.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe “Activities” are supposed to make progress on the objectives, but how will we know if that’s actually happening? They’re supposed to deflating the challenges, but are they really getting eliminated?\\nIn the ideal case, we should measure progress with numbers that are objective, well-defined, measured daily, and have a clear “stopping-point” where we can declare victory. But we all know that most things we can measure aren’t so ideal, and sometimes the most important things aren’t a number.\\nTo the extent that important things are numbers, use this KPI framework to decide what things should be measured, and as a checklist of what a “good” metric is.\\nFor concepts that are not a number, capture their essence in writing. Make the language crisp and obvious not only inside the team but to outside stakeholders. Nowadays you can use AI to take a rambling audio description and turn it into a pithy statement. An example might be: “Be revered as the most innovative product in the category” or “Have the best social media content.”\\nThese statements can be surprisingly powerful despite not being connected to a number. Even when people disagree later whether we’re making progress against them, those are exactly the right sorts of debates to have, because you’re sorting out how things are going, and whether you should make a change. That’s the point of metrics.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nNot Doing \\n\\nNarrative Plot Point\\nHere’s what we’re not doing (yet).\\nGuiding question\\nWhat do we really want to do, but we just have to wait so that even more important or urgent things can be done?\\nWhy can’t we skip this section?\\nDecisions are about saying “no” even more than saying “yes.” Without articulating the “no’s,” the team is less focused, the decisions are less clear, and stakeholders wonder whether you’re even aware of the problems that you chose not to tackle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.\\n—Warren Buffett\\n\\n\\nDeciding to do a few things always means deciding not to do dozens of other things.\\n“Well, not doing them now” we like to say, to put the listener at ease. But actually, most of them are “not ever,” because we always have 10x more ideas than we have time to execute. That’s the lesson of every Jira backlog, feature-collection system, or prioritization spreadsheet.\\nWhen you don’t articulate what we’re not doing, it can appear that you don’t even know those things exist. Perception is reality. Stakeholders or even people on the team believe you’re ignoring important things, when in fact you’ve selected certain important things. You need to say that out loud.\\nIt’s not just about proving yourself to an executive, it’s about reminding yourself and your own team, especially when a big customer complains about one of the things you’re putting off, and the pressure is on, the emotions are high, and you need the resolve to stand firm on “no.”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can do anything, but not everything.\\n—Derek Sivers\\n\\n\\nNext quarter, when you’re going through this process again, this is a great list to revisit. You’ll be surprised how many items seem less important now than before. And some might be more important; that just means that perhaps now is the time.\\nAt WP Engine this a simple bullet-point list, just one line per bullet. It says what the topic is, and doesn’t even explain why it wasn’t selected. You could go further, explaining why each didn’t make the cut. You could go still further, creating a “Now / Next / Later” roadmap5.\\n\\n5\\n Or, my personal preference in that three-column genre: “Now / Likely / Plausible.” This better indicates not only timeline but our confidence that those are even the right ideas. After all, how many of those “Later” items do you ever get to? If the answer isn’t at least 50%, then they’re not “Later,” they are merely a possibility.\\nRemember, this isn’t a random bucket of 100 feature-requests. It’s a list of things that are important, possibly even seem urgent, that you really do want to do, that maybe only barely didn’t make the cut. In short, these were the difficult decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1000 things.\\n—Steve Jobs.\\n\\n\\nFull Example: Tesla \\nThe final result is clear and simple, hiding the complexity of the process that created it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s use Tesla as the example, because although it’s over-used, that means you’re probably familiar with it, and thus you can see how it all comes together:\\nStrategic Objectives \\nTesla’s long-term vision is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy through the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).\\nTo do that, we need to:\\n\\nInvent vehicles that are not only battery-powered but also desirable, because of their performance and safety.\\nCreate production lines that are scalable but also cost-effective, so we can be profitable.\\nGenerate excitement and loyalty by bucking consumer expectations that EVs are impractical and have low performance.\\n\\nObstacles \\nThese obstacles stand in our way of achieving our vision:\\n\\nIntrinsic difficulty: Inventing new types of battery and production lines is near-impossible.\\nMarket Skepticism: Overcoming consumer and industry skepticism about the viability of EVs.\\nManufacturing challenges: Scaling up production to meet demand.\\nInfrastructure: Lack of widespread EV charging infrastructure creates range-anxiety.\\n\\nMain Activities \\nWe will overcome these obstacles while achieving our strategic objectives by:\\n\\nInnovate in Battery Technology: The insight is that the battery is the key. Develop more efficient, longer-lasting, fast-discharge batteries.\\nDirect-to-Consumer Sales: Bypass traditional dealership models to control pricing and customer experience.\\nScale Production: Invest in Gigafactories to massively increase production capacity, hiring specialists and investing with the insight that factories are not just a necessary step but strategically vital.\\nInfrastructure Development: Invest in a network of Supercharger stations for convenient charging.\\n\\nMetrics & Indicators \\nWe know whether these activities are working through:\\n\\nBattery Cost and Efficiency: Measure improvements in battery cost per kWh and immediate-discharge rate.\\nVehicle Sales and Market Share: Track the number of units sold and market share in the EV sector.\\nProduction Capacity: Measure fully-completed cars/day per Gigafactory.\\nInfrastructure Expansion: Number of new Supercharger stations operational.\\nConsumer Delight: People absolutely love their Teslas, calling it a magical experience and never wanting a gas-powered car again. (not a number)\\n\\nNot doing \\nWe are intentionally not doing these valuable, important things, so that we can focus on the above:\\n\\nSafety and Practicality: Although we believe eventually we will make the safest sedans in the world, first we have to solve the challenges of batteries and performance, because those are the obstacles. We know that safety is a matter of good design, but we already know from existing EVs that if the car is safe, but not performant and low-range, then it will not be popular. So we have to solve those first.\\nAffordable models: The company will truly scale and make the impact we want in the world, when it is accessible to most people. But at first, before factories are at scale, before the bugs are worked out, before all the costs are minimized, our cars have to be expensive. So we have to start out as a luxury brand.\\nExpand to China: The second-largest market in the world, eventually will be the largest, and the first manufacturer there might have a decisive advantage. But it is its own special challenge, and we need a popular car that works before we jump into that pool.\\n\\n\\nTesla is often lauded for having a clear strategy, and you’ve heard them report the metrics above as indicators of progress or succeess.\\nYou need a plan that is just as clear. Each team needs one, and your company needs one.\\nOtherwise, you’re probably not working on the right things, and certainly not communicating what must be done, in a way that everyone can understand and implement.\\nTell your story.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/strategic-planning/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuarterly strategic planning using the fairytale structure\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)The Fairytale cheat codeThe narrative structure of the strategic Fairytale PlanStrategic ObjectivesObstaclesMain ActivitiesMetrics & IndicatorsNot DoingFull Example: Tesla\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Here’s how to identify and avoid this trap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome things cannot be measured, even after months pass and we have all the facts and data and analysis at our disposal.\\nIf they cannot be measured in retrospect, they cannot be measured now, and you certainly cannot predict them or make a goal from them.\\nThis sounds obvious, but many of these are so tempting, seemingly so important, we end up trying anyway. But it’s a frustrating waste of time, and we ultimately fail.\\nHere’s some common examples so you can train your pattern-matching engine, and see how to navigate the conversations.\\nImpact of a single feature on the revenue of a product \\nThere are features at WP Engine which sales team pitch because people respond with genuine excitement. But then, after the sale, customers rarely use them1. Does that lack of usage mean the feature isn’t contributing to revenue? No, it might have helped the sale2.\\n\\n1\\n Don’t worry, we don’t charge extra for those features, so it’s not unethical.\\n2\\n P.S. Do you think it’s wise for our competitors to copy those features? This is why you need to listen to customers instead of copying your competitors; who knows what’s going on over there.\\nA feature that is used frequently is almost surely valuable; it’s reasonable to claim that this feature is one of the main reasons why people pay for the product. But how much influence is it really? What if ten other features are also used frequently; do each “earn” 10% of the revenue? What if the feature is also used frequently by people who cancel—that would indicate the feature wasn’t keeping them here after all. But maybe it was, and something totally unrelated caused the cancellation. What about all those other reasons customers are willing to pay that are unrelated to that oft-used feature?\\nThis is too difficult to unravel. This is why I like using a variety of KPIs, only one of which is “usage.” Of course product teams should celebrate when they create features that are widely used. It’s just not the same thing as revenue.\\nEven after the fact, with 100s of 1000s of customers (in our case at WP Engine), it’s still not possible to attribute revenue to individual features.\\nImpact of incremental activities on customer churn \\nAs covered in another article, customer churn severely limits growth and, more importantly, is a lagging indicator that customers don’t want what you’re selling. Therefore, it’s almost always a good use of time to uncover the main drivers of churn, and address them with product, process, people, price, and other words that start with “p.”\\nSo the common and very reasonable question is: If we do X, how much will churn go down? And while we’re actually doing X, how much is churn going down? And this leads to the crux: A year from now, will you then know the impact X had on churn? Unless X has an enormous and immediate impact, the answer is no.\\nThe reasons often apply in cases besides churn, so let’s list them separately to train your pattern-matching engine, while continuing to use churn as the example:\\n\\nCannot measure rare things, because signal is swamped by noise\\nIf churn is 3%/mo, an initiative that reduces churn by 10%—a big impact!—will result in 2.7%/mo. How hard is it to measure a difference of 0.3%, month over month? How much does churn vary through pure randomness? Probably more than that. Some months have 15% more weekdays than subsequent months; if most customers churns on weekdays, that could make churn vary by 15% for that reason alone—again, pure noise. You probably just can’t measure something that is so rare.\\nLag between action and reaction\\nA customer who churns today has probably been unsuccessful for a while. They’ve been researching alternatives for weeks or months, weighing whether to pull the trigger. Larger customers might have tried to make it work for a year or more, then ran a multi-month process to investigate the options. So, an activity you start today is unlikely to change the trajectory of customers who have already decided to leave, and only today happened to push the red button.\\nMany causes of a result, means it’s hard to measure a change in any one cause\\nThere are many reasons why people leave. Some were never that interested, and didn’t get hooked. Some got mad because of support interactions, even though they like the product. Some finally gave up waiting for you to make a feature they’ve needed, even though they love the support interactions. Some were never the right fit, but tried to make it work, and so did you. Some forgot they even had it unless their spouse asked what this credit card charge is. So any one action you take is likely incremental, difficult to measure in the fog of almost every customer not caring about that particular thing.\\nExternal forces that are larger than forces under your control\\nThe market, competition, and the economy at large has a large yet unmeasurable impact. You can just go blaming the global economy—you have a business to run, and you are in control of more than you’re currently controlling. Still, it’s easy to map things like growth rates and churn rates onto the US stock market or inflation. Sometimes it can be the largest factor. How, in the face of these major factors, will you measure the tiny blips that your incremental work might accomplish?\\n\\nDoes this mean we shouldn’t work on improving churn? Of course not—again it’s one of the most valuable things any company can do, because retention compounds, and all the profit generated by a customer of a SaaS business happens in the later years, after they’ve paid back the sales and marketing expenses, gotten past the higher-than-average initial support load, and after your gross margins expand with scale.\\nBut, trying to measure the impact of a single activity is folly3; even a year later, you’ll never know how much that factored in relative to all the other things.\\n\\n3\\n The exception is when your churn is especially bad; anything over 3%/mo is scary. Then, sometimes it’s possible to make large improvements.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nProbabilities of “risks” \\nThe “Risk Slide” lists things that could derail the project or even tank the company. Executives quite rightly want to know: What is the chance that this will happen, and what is the magnitude of the impact if it does?\\nWe can’t invest in mitigating low-probability risks, although we might monitor the situation if the impact would be high. Conversely, high-probability risks might need proactive mitigation efforts. Thus the “probability of the event” is critical information, because it determines our actions.\\nBut these probabilities aren’t possible to measure, even after the fact.\\nEach risk is independent. It will happen, or it won’t. You won’t find out for months, maybe years. Then one or two happen and six don’t. Maybe the one that happened was listed as a 30% probability4, and one that didn’t was listed at 70%. Does that mean the probabilities were wrong? No, because 30% doesn’t mean 0% and 70% doesn’t mean 100%.\\n\\n4\\n If you’re lucky; I often see probabilities listed as “medium” or “low.” Here’s how to talk about probabilities properly.\\nThis is similar to weather forecasting. If there’s a 30% chance of rain, and it rains, was the forecast correct? While you cannot answer that for a single day, there is an answer across hundreds of days: You take all of the days for which the forecast was 30%, and see how often it did rain. If the real result is, say, 34%, the forecaster is doing a great job; if the real number is 70%, the forecaster needs improvement5.\\n\\n5\\n Actually that’s not the full story; here is the fascinating math behind evaluating forecasts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s great, but not for our Risk Slide. We don’t have hundreds of measurements from forecasts of well-defined events. We have a slide of a handful of independent, complex risks, none of which have ever happened before. So we can’t know whether our probabilities were correct, even years later when we know with complete certainty what actually happened.\\nSo don’t put probabilities on the slide at all. Only list the risks that you feel are so important that they either merit action or awareness.\\nMore examples \\nNow that the general pattern is clear, here are more examples to avoid:\\n\\nMeasuring the effect of small design choices on user experience\\nThings like color, typography, layout, and word-choice, definitely matter, but typically noise overwhelms signal in attempting to measure it, especially in small iterations, and it’s not effective to survey users about exactly which font they like better. Also, any UI change initially results in lower satisfaction scores, because people don’t like change.\\nMeasuring the effect or ROI of company culture or values\\nHaving a strong culture, with a specific direction, helps you create a healthy organization of people who are alike in the ways that matter, while creating diversity in all other ways. But, measuring the impact of a specific value or a specific culture-related initiative, doesn’t make sense.\\nMeasuring the value of brand\\nWhile there are some techniques that could make sense for the largest companies in the world (e.g. “unaided awareness” or “brand recall”), you generally cannot look at winning specific deals, or competitiveness, or growth, and answer “How much of that was due to brand?” This includes marketing campaigns that are primarily about brand, such as company-sponsored events.\\nMeasuring the value of proactively fixing bugs or good engineering practices\\nYou cannot measure the impact of a bug that never shipped, or the impact of an engineering practice that is simply how you work. There is no counter-factual.\\nMeasuring “willingness-to-pay” or “value delivered”\\nI’ve detailed a theory of willingness-to-pay as a path both to profits and genuinely happy customers, yet directly measuring “value” or “willingness” is elusive. Even if you raise prices, and measure the change in the number of new customers or the ire and cancellation of existing customers, that still doesn’t measure “value” or “willingness.” Anyway, that’s a test you cannot run often, and a test that’s often destructive for brand and customer relationships.\\nMeasuring the efficacy of employee compensation or retention programs\\nOverall retention is easy and important to measure, but it is always multi-factored, and the rules can change over time. Thus this is like measuring the impact of a feature on product retention.\\n\\nSo stick with KPIs that measure specific aspects of your systems, and stay clear of things you cannot measure even after the fact.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/unmeasurable-metrics/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMetrics that cannot even be measured in retrospect\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Impact of a single feature on the revenue of a productImpact of incremental activities on customer churnProbabilities of “risks”More examples\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

They will not turn into a “typical big company.”\\nBy which they mean: No stupid rules that assume employees are dumb or evil, with everything taking ten times longer than it should, with wall-to-wall meetings, and hiring “average” or “normal” people.\\nThat is, preserving the positive characteristics of tiny organizations while avoiding the common problems of large ones, by adapting the startup’s existing processes, that have served them so well thus far. We’re merely doing it with more people now, and still figuring it out as we go along, exactly as we always have.\\nWhy do they never succeed? Why is it impossible for all of these intelligent, well-meaning founders to run a 500-person organization like a 50-person one? What are these unavoidable forces of scale?\\nAre they really unavoidable?\\nThe two fundamental challenges of scale \\nAfter understanding these two primary drivers, we’ll see how they explain the challenges that arise in every corner of the business.\\nRare things become common \\nAt scale, rare things become common, as fully explored in that linked companion article.\\nRare things are difficult to predict, and typically difficult to prevent. Before scale, they are, well, rare, so this doesn’t matter; they can be handled manually. But when they start happening daily, new processes become necessary.\\nFor instance, with 1,000 servers, a server failure every three years translates to one failure per day. This frequency impacts not just DevOps but also customer support and social media teams. Customers are impacted and complaining every day, even if each individual event is rare, impossible to predict, and impossible to prevent. Automation helps, but doesn’t solve the problem.\\nThis is inescapable math crops up all over the business.\\nComplexity beyond human comprehension \\nHuman minds have limited computational abilities. A sufficiently complex system cannot be fully comprehended at all.\\n“Complicated” systems can be comprehended. These types of systems are intricate, but they exhibit properties which allow people to tame the beast. Components of complicated systems can be separated, built and tested on their own, then assembled; thus, divide-and-conquer is a useful technique. Challenges are difficult but are solvable, especially if you have seen them before; thus, “experts” and “specialists” can solve the puzzles. Repeatable processes can monitor the system.\\n“Complex” systems, in contrast, have components which affect each other, often cyclically. Therefore, while it’s still useful to build and test components separately, there’s just as much complexity in their interaction. Indeed, most of the difficulty lies in those interstitial spaces. The human brain is composed of neuron “components” which are relatively well-understood; it’s in the complex, multi-directional, cyclical interactions that everything interesting—and inscrutable—unfolds. Large-scale effects like “consciousness” completely evade our understanding, as it emerges from complexity we have yet to comprehend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nThis terminology comes from the Cynefin Framework.\\n\\n\\nAs a company scales, there are both kinds of systems, but the complex ones are fundamentally difficult, and never stop being difficult. Their difficulty grows non-linearly as the company grows.\\nAnd even our unthinkably complex human brains, cannot comprehend the system.\\n\\nWith the two fundamental principles in hand, we can detail specific challenges of scale.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nThe human cost of robust teams \\nA “team of one” is the fastest, most efficient team, if you measure by “output per person.” There’s no communication, no meetings, and decisions can be made instantly. Small companies operate this way by necessity, and it works! It’s a big reason why they move quickly, and “punch above their weight” as is often said.\\nBut, an illness takes the velocity of the product or the quality of customer service from heroic to zero. With a small team, if one person leaves, you’ve just lost six months to hiring and getting-up-to-speed on that project. Or twelve months or a complete rewrite because there wasn’t any processes and documentation in place… because it was just one person, who didn’t need that stuff, because after all we’re moving so quickly! And not communicating!\\nOr it’s fatal because that was a co-founder. “Founder trouble” is a leading cause of startup death1.\\n\\n1\\n Although data also show that companies with only one founder are more likely to fail. So which is better? To me, it comes down to temperament—some people really want to be the only one at the top, and some want to share the burdens with others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo a team of one is fast, but brittle. When you’re small, this is a good trade-off, because speed is critical for combating the things that are constantly about to kill the company—lack of customers, lack of market attention, lack of core features, all the things. When you’re large, with 15-25% annual employee turnover, not to mention illness, vacation, and family, people will be leaving (temporarily or permanently) every day—rare things becoming common. Maintaining the same attitude as when you were tiny is disorganized and irresponsible, and the company would fail to function.\\nSo, at scale, no project can have fewer than, say, three people dedicated to it, plus management and possibly some form of Product or Project Management. But that team of 4-5 will not be 4x-5x more productive than the one-person team; per-person productivity goes down in exchange for robustness and continuity.\\nOn the other hand, while the small company loses 9 months to the loss of a key employee, or even implodes, the big company is the steady turtle that adds thousands of customer per month like clockwork and wins the race.\\nThe high cost of robust systems \\nYou might think that software systems wouldn’t suffer the same brittleness as human systems, because we have things like automation and DevOps. Sadly, robust software is similarly much more costly and complicated.\\nConsider the case of serving a website (don’t worry, you don’t need to be an software engineer to follow this example!). Suppose there’s a network connection to the Internet, a server that runs the web site’s software, and a database that holds the web site’s content. We have a single server, and it works most of the time. Let’s say it works 99.9% of the time; that’s sounds pretty good!\\nWell, it’s not that good, actually. Failing for 0.1% of a year means it has failed for more than 500 minutes—surely an unacceptable amount of down-time! This happens because a rare thing (0.1% failure) became common (at the scale of about half a million minutes in a year).\\nWhat if we had two servers instead? That way, when one fails, the other is still available. They’d both have to fail simultaneously for the website to be offline, which would happen 0.1%\\xa0×\\xa00.1%\\xa0=\\xa00.0001% of the time, which would be only 30 seconds per year, so that really is great2.\\nOK, that’s twice as expensive, because we now have two servers, but it’s worth it for being more robust3. But wait, that’s not enough, because the traffic that comes in from the Internet needs to be distributed across the two servers, and it needs to have some intelligence to route traffic to the healthy one, in case one is failing. That’s called a “Load Balancer,” and all cloud infrastructure providers have them, and they cost more money. So that’s another component to manage, and more expense.\\n\\n2\\n Sadly this is not really how the world works; typically failures are correlated or cascade. We’ll keep things simple for sake of the example, but this complication proves the point yet again.\\n3\\n You might think we can save money by buying cheaper servers, because each needs only one half the capacity of the original. But no, because in the failure mode, a single server still needs to serve all the traffic, so each needs to be powerful enough to work on its own.\\nAnd wait, there’s also that database. The two servers need to share a common database of content, so the database needs to be moved off to its own server. And what if that server fails? Then we have downtime again. So we also need two of those for continuity.\\nNow we’re up to four servers plus a Load Balancer, and more than 4x the original cost. You can buy robustness, but it’s far more expensive than you might think. We haven’t even gotten to the fact that managing multiple servers is more difficult, or that there can be failures in the communications between servers, or failures in the Load Balancer which takes down the whole system4—all decreasing our robustness, requiring even more effort to deliver the end result.\\n\\n4\\n Yes, there’s solutions to this too—more redundancy at the network layer, often with a different vendor, but again, all more cost and complication!\\nRobustness always carries a cost. Whether it’s running four servers instead of one, or a team of four instead of one, you trade local inefficiency for whole-company continuity.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nPredictability (that you actually need) \\nWhen you’re small there’s no need to predict when a feature will ship. Marketing isn’t scheduling a launch and Recruiting isn’t timing the start-dates of the next 50 hires in customer service and sales. This means you can—and should!—optimize myopically for speed-to-market.\\nSmall companies correctly brag about their speed as an advantage, but it’s easy to see how a larger company has a different—and massive—advantage of execution. Sure, when our company WP Engine launches a new product, the marketing department needs predictability for the launch date, but that’s because it’s a highly-skilled, well-funded, coordinate group of teams that explode with press, events, campaigns, social media, and newsletters, grabbing more attention in a single week than a smaller company might scrape together in a year. There are also global Sales and Support teams, so we’re immediately selling to 200,000 existing customers as well as thousands of new customers per month, which means we’ll add more additional revenue each month than a small company will earn over a whole year.\\nBut all this requires predictability. We didn’t line up that press and have those sales materials and train hundreds of support reps and ensure that code-quality is high enough to scale on day one, without predictability. Predictability requires going slower. Predictability requires estimation (takes time), coordination (takes time), planning (takes time), documentation (takes time), and adjusting the plan across all teams when life inevitably unfolds differently from the prediction (takes time).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you’re hiring lots of people, you need predictability. Consider the timeline of adding a technical support team member. First, Recruiting is casting about for potential candidates. Then scheduling and performing interviews. Then waiting for them to quit their job and take a week off. Then new-employee-orientation. Then classroom training. Then paired up with senior folks on the floor as they ramp up their skills and comfort. Therefore the time between deciding to grow the support team, and having new people up-to-speed, is four to six months.\\nTherefore, we have to predict the demand for technical support four to six months in advance, because we need to be hiring for that right now. If we under-estimate, our support folks get overwhelmed with too much work; their quality of life suffers, and service to each customer suffers. If we over-estimate, we have too many people, which is a cost penalty. Of course the latter is a better failure mode than the former, but both are sub-optimal, and the solution is predictability.\\n“The future is inherently unpredictable,” insists the small company, spurred on by Lean and Agile mindsets, and the truth. Indeed, blue-sky invention and execution are unpredictable. But this is also a self-fulfilling prophecy; to insist the future is unpredictable is to ignore the work that could make it more predictable, which makes it in fact unpredictable to that person.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall companies don’t have the data, customers, institutional knowledge, expertise, and often the personal experience and skillset to predict the future, so they are usually correct in saying it’s impossible. But is it impossible in principle, or is it impossible for them? At scale, it becomes required. Not because Wall Street demands it, nor because investors demand it, nor any other causal derogatory excuse made by unpredictable organizations, but because it’s critical for healthy scaling.\\nThe Materiality Threshold \\nIf Google launches a new product that generates $10,000,000/year in revenue, is that good? No, it’s a failure. They could have taken the tens of millions of dollars that the product cost to develop, used that to make their existing operation just 0.01% more effective, and made far more money.\\nAt more than $100B/year in revenue5, Google can only consider products which have the potential to generate $1B/year in revenue as an absolute floor, with the potential to grow to $10B/year if things go better than expected. Things like YouTube, Cloud, and self-driving cars.\\n\\n5\\n Editor’s note: This was originally written in 2017; in 2023 Google’s revenue is nearly $300B, which reinforces the original point; they could not have achieved that growth if they worked on projects that generated revenues of “merely” $100M.\\nThis principle is called the “Materiality Threshold,” i.e. the minimum contribution a project must deliver, for the project to materially affect the business.\\nWith a small business, the materiality threshold is near $0. A new feature that helps you land just a few new customers this month is worth doing. A marketing campaign that adds two sign-ups/week is a success. Almost anything you do, counts. That’s nice—it feels good to be moving forward.\\nThe financial success of the larger company dictates a non-trivial materiality threshold. This is difficult. Even a modest-sized company will need millions in revenue from new products, maybe tens of millions in the optimistic case. Very few products can generate that sort of revenue, whether invented by nimble, innovative startups or stately mature companies. As proof, consider that the vast majority of startups never reach a $10M/year run-rate, even with decent products and extraordinarily dedicated and capable teams.\\nYet, it’s the job of a Product Manager at that mid-sized company to invent, discover, design, implement, and nurture exactly those products—something that most entrepreneurs will never succeed at. Tough job!\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nRecruiting \\nEmployee #2 will join a startup for the experience. Even with a significant salary cut, and even if the company fails—the most likely outcome—it’s worth it for the stories, the influence, the potential, the thrill, the control, the camaraderie, the cocktail-party-talk.\\nEmployee #200 won’t join for those reasons. Employee #200 will have a different risk-profile regarding their life and career. Employee #200 will be interested in different sorts of problems to solve, like the ones listed in this article instead of the ones where you’re trying to understand why 7 people bought the software but the next 3 didn’t. Employee #200 will not work for a pay-cut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall companies view this as an advantage, and certainly it’s advantageous to recruit amazing people at sub-market rates. But there hundreds of employees at WP Engine today who are much more skilled in their area of expertise than I’ve ever met at a small startup, including my own. Why?\\nOne reason is that people with a lot of experience are often in a different phase of life, where family and other demands means they want a predictable, larger paycheck for a predictable, well-defined job. When you combine their advanced skills with the raw materials of a scaled company (i.e. customers, brand, funding, teams that can execute larger ideas), they can generate huge value while still tucking their kids into bed at night.\\nAnother reason is that, after developing that expertise, they find it’s enjoyable to apply their skills within a larger environment. For example, there are advanced marketing techniques that would never make sense with a smaller company, that are fascinating, challenging, and impactful to the top line at a larger company. There are talented people who love that challenge and would hate going “back to Kindergarten” as Jeff Bezos famously quipped, scratching out an AdWords campaign with a $2000/mo budget or assembling the rudiments of SEO or just trying to get a single marketing channel to work or being called a “growth hacker” because they finagled a one-time bump in traffic.\\nThis has implications on compensation, how you find that talent, and why that person wants to work at your company instead of the one down the block who can pay a little bit more. Therefore, it’s critical to have a mission that is genuinely important, have meaningful and interesting work to do, connect everyone’s work to something bigger than any of us. These matter even more at scale, because it’s the reason why talent will join and stay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommunication \\nWith four people in a company, any information that everyone needs to know can be told to just three other people. Everyone can know everything. If there’s a 5% chance of significant misunderstanding, that doesn’t happen often.\\nWith four hundred people, it’s never true that a piece of information can be reliably communicated, in a short period of time. A 5% chance of misunderstanding means twenty people are confused. That’s assuming they even read the communication, or listened during the entire presentation over Zoom. What’s the chance of that? Don’t ask.\\n“Slack” is not the answer. “Email” is not the answer. The answer is: Repeating simple messages.\\n“Repetition” is the answer to “I didn’t see it.” Repetition in different formats, at different times, by many leaders. Asymptotically achieving 100%, although also creating collateral damage for the people who really do read and listen to everything, who are tired of hearing the same thing, and wondering why they’re being punished for actually paying attention.\\n“Simple” is the answer to “I didn’t understand / remember it.” Just as with simplicity in strategy, you have to accept that people don’t read, people don’t remember, people have other things on their minds, people don’t understand language as well as you wish, and you didn’t write as clearly as you hoped.\\nBut doesn’t this mean you cannot communicate anything complex to 1000 people? Yes, that’s what it means. Scale is hard.\\nTechnology & Infrastructure \\nManaging 10,000 virtual servers in the Cloud Era sounds easy. Automate everything, then any process that works for 100 servers, will work for 10,000 servers just by doing the same thing repeatedly—exactly the thing computers are excellent at.\\nIt never works like that. Reddit took 18 months to get “number of likes” to work at scale. StackOverflow took 4 years to get everything converted to HTTPS. Wired did that conversion in a “mere” 18 months. Everything is hard at scale.\\nWhat are the patterns in those stories?\\nOne is another application of “rare things are common.” Rare things are hard to predict and can be hard to prevent. Often they’re hard to even identify and sometimes impossible to reproduce. This is fundamentally difficult.\\nAnother is continuity or compatibility with existing technology. New companies get to start from scratch, but at-scale companies must transform. New companies like to make fun of large companies for how hard it is to transform, neglecting that the cause of the difficulty might also be generating $100,000,000 in revenue this year6.\\n\\n6\\n Instead of “legacy code” we call it the “revenue code.“\\nAnother is bottlenecking. All hardware and software systems have bottlenecks. At small scale, you don’t run into any bottlenecks, or at least the ones you do can be solved with simple techniques like increasing capacity. Eventually something difficult breaks and you have to rearchitect the stack to solve it. Even something simple like converting HTTP links to HTTPS or updating “number of likes” in real-time, becomes a monumental architectural challenge.\\nAnother is Hickam’s Dictum: Problems in complex systems generally have more than one root cause. Consider the case of a software upgrade causing problems for seven customers, in a way that wasn’t detected. What is the “root cause” of this problem?\\n\\nThe problem is we didn’t detect the failure; had we done so, we could have reversed the upgrade immediately.\\nThe problem is we didn’t test the thing that failed; had we had more tests, the problem would never have reached customers.\\nThe problem is we didn’t document the code that broke; had the code been clearer, the human wouldn’t have coded the error.\\nThe problem is we didn’t review the code properly; had the code been reviewed with a proper checklist, we would have discovered the bad code before it was deployed.\\n\\nAs with Five Whys, there are always deeper reasons, as well as different reasons. Different from Five Whys, there isn’t just one that is the “root” cause; instead there are a lot of things that interact with a lot of things. This doesn’t mean it’s hopeless, it just means it’s complex to analyze, complex to decide what to do, and that Occam’s Razor doesn’t apply.\\nAll this slows down development and adds investment. There will be entire teams who focus on infrastructure, scaling, deploys, cost-management, development processes, and so forth, none of which are directly visible to or driven by the customer, but which are necessary to manage the complexities of scale.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nRisk-mitigation \\nFor a small company, the most likely cause of death is suicide. Usually it’s starvation—can’t get enough customers (distribution) to pay enough money for long enough (product), in the cascade of things-that-must-be-true for product/market fit. But also things like founders splitting up, not getting enough traction to self-fund or to secure the next round of financing, having to go back to a day job, and so on.\\nAt scale, the risks are different. There is very low risk that WP Engine will not sign up thousands of new customers this month. Other risks, however, are not only possible, but likely. Addressing those risks head-on, is required for a healthy and sustainable business that can last for many years.\\nTake the risk of business continuity during a disaster scenario. What if an entire Amazon datacenter became disabled for a week? How quickly could we get all those customers back up and running? Would that be true even though thousands of other businesses are also trying to spin up servers in other Amazon data centers at the same time? Could we communicate all this with our customers quickly and simply, so that our support team isn’t overwhelmed by repeating the same message to tens of thousands of justifiably-angry customers?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRisk-mitigation can even result in growth. Serious customers want to work with vendors who understand and mitigate risk; this maturity becomes a selling point. That’s why enterprise suppliers (like WP Engine) are constantly flouting their compliance with SOC 2 and ISO 27001 and all the others. Small companies make fun of those things as being unnecessary at best or a false sense of security at worst, but while they’re busy making that point, the larger companies are busy signing three-year multi-million dollar deals.\\nEarly on, you do not need a disaster-recovery plan. That won’t be the thing that will kill the business, and your customers will understand if a young business is subject to that sort of risk. Later on, this becomes critical, and worth investing in.\\nLarge companies are not just small companies × 100 \\nThese forces cause larger companies to be fundamentally different than small ones. It isn’t a bad thing or a good thing. It’s a different thing.\\nSome idealistic founders believe the root cause of scaling issues is the “command-and-control” organizational structure. But none of the examples above make reference to any organizational structure. It’s universal. This is why Holacracy and Teal Organizations do not solve these problems. It could be a fantastic idea to experiment with organizational structure, but the fundamental forces above will not be eliminated with a recombination of roles and power structures.\\nScaling is hard, the road is foggy and bendy, it lasts for years, the set of people you need might be different, and no one emerges unscathed. So, it is not a sign of disaster if you have difficulty wrestling with these forces. Everyone does.\\nDisaster is when a company is scaling, but the leaders don’t appreciate these forces, don’t work constantly to morph the organization accordingly, don’t bring in experienced talent, decide they can figure it all out as they go along without help. Rather, it should mean new people, new roles, new values, new processes, new recruiting, new stories, new constraints, new opportunities.\\nToo many founders and leaders want to believe:\\n\\nWhat got us here is what’s important and unique about us, and thus we should preserve all of it. Other companies fail because they “act like big companies,” but we’ll avoid all that because we’re smarter than they were. As evidence of our acuity, just look at our success thus far. We will continue to succeed in the future as we have in the past.\\n\\nBut they’re wrong.\\nThere should be a few values that are kept constant, that’s true. Otherwise none of it means anything.

Use words other than “failure” to describe situations and to suggest the next step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not fail fast. It’s not fail forward. It’s not “fail” at all.\\n“Fail” is almost never the right word for what is happening. It’s so final, so negative, and it’s a dead end: What do you do after a failure? Mope?\\nWords have meaning. They can explain what’s really going on, and suggest what should be done next. The word “fail” accomplishes neither.\\nExploring new territory \\nIf you’re solving a maze, and a path doesn’t work out, you haven’t “failed,” you’ve only backtracked. This is a necessary and natural aspect of exploration and creating businesses and products; in fact it’s even called the idea maze. It often comes in the form of an experiment. The result of an experiment is evidence supporting or rejecting the hypothesis. Neither result is a “failure.” A/B testing is a good practice, even though most of the time you will not have stumbled upon an improvement.\\nWords you could use instead of “fail” include: experiment, test, bet, learning, investigate, trial, retry, probe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you’ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you’ve made a discovery\\n—Enrico Fermi\\n\\n\\nRevolutionizing \\nIf you’re creating something new, never accomplished by anyone before, and it doesn’t immediately revolutionize the industry, you haven’t “failed,” you’ve just not yet found the breakthrough. Often innovations require many trials before the right solution is uncovered. If the right answer were obvious, it wouldn’t be an innovation.\\nWords you could use instead of “fail” include: backtrack, iterate, trial, attempt, step, miss.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.\\n—Thomas A. Edison\\n\\n\\nLearning \\nIf you’re learning a new skill, and you stumble, get confused, get lost, or think you’ve mastered it only to find there’s still a long road ahead, you haven’t “failed,” you’re growing. No good teacher would get mad at a student for not learning a skill instantly, or even sliding backward. The learning curve is well-understood, and it is not a straight line.\\nWords you could use instead of “fail” include: practice, cultivate, acquire, develop, learning curve, learning moment, trial, progression, evolve.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am always doing that which I can not do, in order that I may learn how to do it.\\n—Vincent van Gogh\\n\\n\\nIterating \\nAre you iterating on something that is fundamentally working, just making it better? This is optimization. Not all attempts at improvement will work, or have as much effect as hoped, but surely we shouldn’t call ourselves “failures” when things are basically fine as they are.\\nWords you could use instead of “fail” include: refine, calibrate, optimize, polish, hone, correct, fine-tune, dial-in.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.\\n—Henry Ford\\n\\n\\nSolving problems \\nAre you solving a problem, but a minor one, particular to your current circumstance, where your high-level strategy and plan is still correct? Problem-solving in a complex space—whether a one-person startup or a thousand-person organization—cannot possibly proceed with innovation and speed and yet also no setbacks, no complications, no false-starts.\\nWords you could use instead of “fail” include: iterate, adapt, adjust, course-correct, tweak, revise, morph, refactor, amend, fix.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\\n—Winston Churchill\\n\\n\\nMajor errors \\nHave you made a major error, perhaps a complete misjudgment, incorrect strategic decision, or a project where months of effort by dozens of people has proved useless? That is indeed a big deal, and perhaps you’re even justified in saying “we failed.” Still, that doesn’t explain its nature, and doesn’t point towards a solution, which would be the constructive thing to do.\\nWords you could use instead of “fail” include: Pivot, evolve, migrate, overhaul, revamp, transform, reconstruct, repurpose, reimagine, redesign, recreate, reinvent, reengineer, remodel, rebrand, realign.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccess is not built on success. It’s built on failure. It’s built on frustration. Sometimes it’s built on catastrophe.\\n—Sumner Redstone\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are moments when we’ve truly, irrevocably, fatally failed, and we should say so. If a company has to shut down, especially before it achieved some meaningful success, then okay, we failed.\\nOtherwise, find a better way to describe what’s happening, so we understand the situation better, and are pointed in the direction of what we should do next.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccess is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.\\n—Winston Churchill\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/fail/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStop saying “fail”\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Exploring new territoryRevolutionizingLearningIteratingSolving problemsMajor errors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Startups can use this concept to beat incumbents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA perfect storm created a renaissance in chess: COVID driving people to occupy their minds in physical isolation, the hit Netflix show “The Queen’s Gambit,” and a surge of chess Twitch streamers and YouTubers fueling that nascent interest in chess with equal parts education and entertainment.\\nAnd so beginners learned openings like the titular Queen’s Gambit—one of the most popular ways for white to open the game. It’s easy to find courses, books, and online content about the Queen’s Gambit because it’s been popular for more than a hundred years. The top chess players in the world today still play the Queen’s Gambit; if they play it, it must be good! And it is.\\nExcept, it’s smarter for beginners to play worse openings.\\n“Worse” is an objective evaluation. There are openings, like the King’s Gambit for example, which were popular in the 1800s but have since been “refuted,” meaning that for each move by white, black always has a counter-move which results in black ultimately achieving a superior position. “Superior” as consistently demonstrated in games between top-level humans, as well as computers that are orders of magnitude stronger than those humans. Thus, the King’s Gambit is objectively worse than the Queen’s Gambit.\\nSo why should beginners use the refuted King’s Gambit opening?\\nFirst of all, beginners aren’t playing top chess players; they are playing someone near their own strength. At their level, the King’s Gambit isn’t refuted, because neither player has memorized the sprawling branching sequences of all possible moves and counter-moves and counter-counter-moves, ad nauseam. Nor can they figure out the best move in the moment.\\nSecond, and more importantly, exactly because the Queen’s Gambit is popular, it’s likely that your opponent has also studied it. So it’s quite possible that your opponent knows a defense to the Queen’s Gambit better than you know the attack of the Queen’s Gambit. As you progress in chess, this becomes more and more likely. So now the question becomes: Is your preparation—memorization of the branching forest of moves—better than your opponent’s preparation?\\nThat’s not the sort of “luck” you want to depend on. That’s not a good strategy.\\nThe solution is to learn a refuted-but-not-completely-atrocious opening like the King’s Gambit. It isn’t refuted at your level, and also there’s almost no chance your opponent has memorized any specific defense for it, because “no one plays that.” So they’re reacting to it for the first time, surely not finding all the best counter-moves in the moment. But you have memorized a few of the best moves. So you have a clear advantage, even though you’re a beginner.\\nThis is why leverage, as defined here, results in a superior strategy for products and companies, even if many things about you, your team, your product, and your company, are “worse” than the competition. Playing on your own terms changes the game. “Worse, but unique,” is in fact “better.”\\nA startup is a “beginner” in the market, facing a variety of “opponents” who have varying degrees of preparation and skill (age, capabilities, customers, brand, funding). A startup needs to fight the competitive battle on its own terms, not attack where the opponent is already strong.\\nEven on a personal level, you must use your leverage to do something special, be something special, at the intersection of what is special, enjoyable, and what the world needs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe yourself. Everyone else is taken.\\n—Oscar Wilde\\n\\n\\nMany potential customers won’t want to play your game, and you’ll feel bad when you lose them to a competitor, and when they say mean things about you and your product and your decisions. Especially when it’s in public, on review sites and social media. But don’t worry, you weren’t going to win them anyway—they’re just not into you.\\nThe customers who do want to play your game, will see that you’re the best in that game. Even if you’re two people and there’s a dozen competitors ranging from well-funded, well-covered-by-the-media startups to old-but-reliable incumbents. If you pick a different game, you’re the best at that game, and you can become extremely successful1.\\n\\n1\\n In my case, WP Engine powers as many substantial websites as Google Cloud or Digital Ocean, and we still have only 2.3% of that market. That means 98% of potential customers are in fact not customers, and yet WP Engine is a unicorn. By the way, this is another reason why it’s wise to seek large markets.\\nEven better than “different,” is to be extreme in that difference. Not just a minimal UI, but so minimal it works on the command-line. Not just great design, but so remarkable people buy it only for that, and it’s written up on designer’s blogs. Not just a new algorithm that solves an old problem, but one that uncovers new things that no one else does, even at the expense of missing things that others catch. You can’t do this for all aspects of your product and business—indeed, even a single one is already powerful—but extremity is how you maximize the power of the few things that make you special.\\nAll those competitors cannot play the game as well as you, because you picked something that was not only different, but extreme. They can’t make every choice you made, and since they didn’t, they’re definitionally not the best at your game.\\nPlay your King’s Gambit. Don’t worry if others claim your strategy is refuted. It’s not refuted for you.\\nIndeed, the fact that they think it’s refuted, is why you will win.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/worse-but-unique/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWorse, but unique\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Another study:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote that the median intended probability of the word “likely” is 70%, whereas the intention of “unlikely” is 20%. Since that is the same word, just negated, we should expect the numbers to be symmetric like 70/30 or 80/20, but instead we’re biased1.\\nEven worse with “probable / improbable” at 70/10, and strangely while “probable” and “probably” are the same at 70%, “probably not” is 25% while “improbable” is 10%. Perhaps that makes sense to a grammatician, but surely this causes confusion in normal people, especially when we’re applying these words in analytical contexts like risk-analysis or debating a strategy.\\n\\n1\\n There is extensive literature on our innate bias regarding both rare and common events; people are surprised how often 5% things happen, and how often 95% don’t. Nassim Taleb’s Black Swan expounds on this, and it’s obvious in our everyday experience, like how we get upset when a “10% chance of rain” rains out our picnic.\\nThe communication problem is even worse because individual people disagree to an even larger extent. For example, here is a single person’s evaluation for these words:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote how pessimistic they are on the positive words, scoring “probable,” “probably,” and “likely” as only 50%. Then matching the median of 20% with their negatives (“probably not,” “we doubt,” “unlikely”), but then they claim “improbable” is a straight-up 0% while “highly unlikely” is still 30%.\\nI feel for this person. Although I admit the formal definition of “improbable” cannot be exactly 0%, what would I think in a real-life case, in which a consensus is that a given project is “improbable” to complete on-time? I would certainly act as though that probability were 0%.\\nSo this is the point: Words don’t work, because the differences between individual interpretations are larger than the differences between the words themselves!\\nFurthermore, even if you assign an official numeric probability to words, and train competent people to adhere to those definitions, it still doesn’t work. The CIA attempted exactly this, publishing what they call the “Sherman Kent Scale.” It explains, for example, that “probable” is defined as 75% and “almost certainly not” is defined as 7%. However, when officers were assessed against the scale, fully half the time they failed to stay in-range (the grey bars):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n“Clearly, the readers in this experiment were not using the Sherman Kent scale even though they were familiar with it.\"—Scott Barclay, author of this study\\n\\n\\nWe should give up on using words to describe probabilities.\\nThe solution: Specific probabilities, Fermi-style \\nAn obvious solution is to force people to always use numeric probabilities, never2 using vague words. Indeed, this one rule will already improve communication.\\n\\n2\\n Oops, I mean 0.2% of the time.\\nBut writing down precise probabilities is hard.\\nIt’s hard because usually3 we cannot specify the probability with precision. The world is often4 unpredictable even with expertise and data, so we need fuzzy ranges of probability to gesture towards our intent.\\n\\n3\\n Oops, I mean 83.6% of the time.\\n4\\n Oops, I mean 62.9% of the time.\\nIn this sense, it could appear more accurate to say “the project is unlikely to succeed” exactly because it’s unknown whether the true probability is 10% or 40%. Still, given individual interpretations of the word “unlikely,” we’re not accurately communicating that range.\\nFurthermore, as we know from Fermi Estimation in domains like “impact” and “time estimation,” it’s unproductive to haggle over details like “is it a 20% or 30% probability.” None of us likely5 knows the true number, and anyway we need crisp signals to make smart decisions.\\n\\n5\\n Oops, I mean 9.1% of the time.\\nTherefore, the solution is a Fermi-style probability:\\n\\nUse numbers, not words.\\nSelect from a small set of options.\\n\\nThis is the same conclusion the CIA came to in the above-referenced 1964 study. Their mistake was to continue using words, but their categorical probabilities were Fermi:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProbability Word\\nProbability Value\\nExpected Range\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCertain\\n100%\\n100%\\n\\n\\nAlmost Certain\\n93%\\n87% … 99%\\n\\n\\nProbable\\n75%\\n63% … 87%\\n\\n\\nChances About Even\\n50%\\n40% … 60%\\n\\n\\nProbably Not\\n30%\\n20% … 40%\\n\\n\\nAlmost Certainly Not\\n7%\\n2% … 12%\\n\\n\\nImpossible\\n0%\\n0%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy recommendation is to use just a few raw numbers, without words, with instructions for “rounding off” that depend on the context.\\nFor example, in estimating the likelihood that a project completes on time, we know that in general things are more likely6 to be late than early, therefore we should “round off” towards the lower probability.\\n\\n6\\n Oops, I mean more than 51% of the time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo go to your “risk” slides, and use Fermi probabilities to force yourself to decide what you think the risk really is, so everyone can decide whether or not to act.\\nGo to your strategy, and put Fermi probabilities on each assertion, so people know what is more or less likely to change as we learn and grow.\\nGo to your work-prioritization system, and put Fermi probabilities on the “value” or “estimate” metrics that you’re using for decision-support. Ask everyone in the team to supply their own numbers independently; where there’s disagreement, that’s worth a discussion; where there’s agreement, you can save time by just moving along.\\nPerhaps the real reason we use wishy-washy probability words is because we really don’t know the probability, and rather than admitting that, we just glide past the challenge.

You could even allow several days, giving people time to think and to schedule the thinking during periods when their brains and work-environments are most effective at tackling such projects.\\n\\n3\\n Do not brain-storm items one-by-one. In live brain-storming the conversations follows the fastest and loudest people, rather than leveraging everyone’s brains to invent different ideas. Live brainstorming filters out ideas that take longer than a few minutes to think of. Live brainstorming eliminates the possibility of having an “ah-ha” moment in the shower. “There is not a single published study in which a face-to-face brainstorming group outperforms a [write-storming] group” observes Leigh Thompson in Creative Conspiracy. Recent research suggests that people are less creative in generating ideas over video-conferencing versus in-person; write-storming restores the creativity because it’s independent, even if the discussion is over Zoom.\\nWhere do ideas come from? Because the exercise is about “what our company claims,” obvious sources are the public website, advertisements, public presentations and webinars, quotes from your employees in the media, sales materials, and support materials like knowledge-base articles or copy/paste shortcuts. If you’re quoting directly, put the phrase in double-quotes to emphasize that “we really do say this!”\\nThere are also the things you’re doing that you’re not talking about. Those things are more difficult to generate. Sources are what you’re maintaining (i.e. existing systems owned by some team), work from recent sprints (i.e. work you’re actually doing), long-term planning documents (i.e. larger initiatives), and prompts like “What are we really good at?” and “What technology assets or human capabilities have we built up over time?”\\nThe hardest things to think of, are the things you’re not talking about and also not doing. Isn’t that an infinite number of things? Yes, but it’s useful to list things you reasonably could say or do, but are intentionally avoiding. One source is backlogs of features requests from customers, support, sales, marketing, product, and engineers; whether you plan to do them eventually or not, they are “items of interest.” Another source is key, differentiating things that competitors are saying or doing (whether you’re avoiding those things purposefully or reluctantly). Yet another is your own long-term plans for big initiatives you haven’t gotten to yet.\\nDebating placement is one-third the value \\nCome together as a group, take each idea in turn, and debate where it should go on the chart. Coalesce duplicates into a single card; if the duplicates were originally strewn all over the chart, that’s even more indication that a discussion is useful. If there’s immediate widespread agreement on the right location for a card, skip the discussion to save time.\\nGenerally you’ll find three sources of disagreements. All three are useful, but in different ways:\\n\\nLack of knowledge\\n“We don’t talk about this.” “Yes we do, it’s in all the sales materials!” “In support, we tell people the opposite.” “We say this in sales but not on the website.” “We used to say that, but not since the latest website revamp.”\\n\\nThis is a great excuse to get everyone up to speed about what we’re saying, and where. If the answer varies (e.g. “we say this a lot on the home page, but nowhere else”), you can place the item more in the middle of the chart, but add a “comment” to record that detail; it will be useful later when you decide how to act on this information.\\n\\nDisagreement on terminology\\nPeople often interpret the same phrase differently. If you can’t agree on what it means internally, imagine how confused customers are! Or a new employee who isn’t part of the echo chamber?\\n\\nAn example will illustrate how this is useful: In a recent exercise at WP Engine, multiple people put “Enterprise-Grade Security” on the board. We talk about this constantly, so no one disagreed that it was high on the “talk” axis. But there was disagreement on “walk,” ranging from the middle to the far-right.\\n\\n\\nBut how is this controversial? We’re well-known for having the best security in the industry. Our customers include some of the largest security companies and financial institutions in the world, both of which maintain the highest bar for security; we are certified with multiple accreditations; we leverage myriad security products covering every layer of the tech stack; we commission third-party pen-tests for every new product and periodically for all products; we conduct annual company-wide training to guard against social engineering attacks; we have formal written security policies that we actually enforce. With all this, how could you not agree “Security” is 100% on “walking the walk?”\\n\\n\\nTurned out, the person who placed it in the middle was specifically thinking about a few items in the backlog that would make a certain corner the platform even more secure. We’d never experienced an incident because of, and there was no reason to believe we would. Still, this person thought, If there’s still a few obvious items in the backlog that we could do, then we’re not yet fully “walking the walk” on security.\\n\\n\\nA discussion resolved the difference of opinion. We decided that “great security” isn’t defined by never having a ticket in the backlog; after all, nearly all software updates contains security patches (check the version history!). That doesn’t mean the software wasn’t already secure. Indeed, it’s the opposite: Being so diligent that we even “fix” things that aren’t broken, thinking a few steps ahead, proactively preventing incidents, is what makes us secure; it’s a sign that we are in fact “walking the walk.”\\n\\n\\nThe group finally agreed that the ticket belongs on the far right side. The realization, however, was helpful both for the engineers who have a better mental model of “what security means,” and for the marketers who have more stories to tell about how excellent our security is.\\n\\nDisagreement on target persona\\nSometimes you realize that a subset of your customers would agree that you’re “walking the walk,” but others would disagree.\\n\\nFor example, perhaps the performance of your product is excellent for most customers, so when you say “fast user interface that never gets in your way,” most people would agree. But maybe 2% of your customers have huge amount of data that slows your UI to a crawl. Furthermore, that 2% are important to you—they might be your reference customers, or the ones paying you the most money.\\n\\n\\nWhat do you do in these fractured circumstances? A simple technique is to place the item in a sort of “weighted” location. So e.g. if 80% of your customers (by revenue) would consider this completely “walking the walk,” but 20% would say it’s pretty low, perhaps you place the item at 80%. However, add a comment to the sticky-note explaining this detail; it will be useful later when you decide what actions you want to take.\\n\\n\\nAnother technique is to split the item. So e.g. “Fast UI (for customers <100 properties)” and also “Fast UI (for customers with ≥100 properties).” Then place them independently.\\n\\n\\nIf you have different, distinct target personas, you might find a lot of the cards are being split. In this case, consider making two different charts altogether, i.e. one for “Talk vs Walk for Persona A” and the other “Talk vs Walk for Persona B.” This is easier to read and to act on.\\n\\n\\nTaking action \\nJust having these discussions is valuable, but most of the value is in doing something with the resulting chart.\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nIn general the question is: Is it useful to take action to shift cards in various directions? It’s useful to consider this by quadrant, because those items have different status quo interpretations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuadrant A: Exaggerations \\nThese are the original source of the line “you talk the talk but you don’t walk the walk.” When you’re “faking it ’till you make it,” but still just faking it. What to do?\\n\\nDo nothing (ethically)\\nWe understand our claims are tenuous. We should ensure that our exaggeration is not unethical, e.g. claiming a medical benefit that does not exist, or charging for a feature that does not work.\\nLive up to your own expectations (shift →)\\nThis message is resonating, and is a critical to our positioning. But if it’s so critical, we have to back it up with reality! We’ll build and ship specific things in the next six months that will allow us to shift these sticky-notes rightward to meet our customers’ expectations.\\nDon’t write checks you can’t cash (shift ↓)\\nWe’re attracting the wrong sort of customers—people who expect something we don’t deliver. As a result they waste time in customer service and then cancel anyway—a net loss for us, and a terrible experience for them. We’re not even getting useful product feedback, because we’re interviewing people who aren’t our target persona. Let’s stop saying these things.\\n\\nQuadrant B: The trusted brand \\nTrust is earned by repeatedly keeping your promises; that’s what’s happening in this quadrant. This is your brand, because it’s what you say and also what customers actually experience. This is a strength, because everything is constructively aligned. What to do?\\n\\nDo nothing\\nWe’re doing well here, but doing incrementally better will not win us more customers (i.e. Kano “must-be” or “indifferent”). Therefore, we should track our performance on this item as a KPI, but rather than continue investing to maximize it, we should only promise that it won’t fall below some minimum threshold of acceptability. This ensures we won’t unintentionally lose this advantage. Instead, focus our attention on accumulating more strengths, or mitigating some issue.\\nLeverage strength for sales (shift ↑)\\nCan we make even more fuss about how awesome we are? More confident competitive positioning, leveraged in advertising, more content marketing on the subject, emphasized more in sales processes, highlighted more in the product UI. We might even be able to make sales by emphasizing one strength above all others.\\nDouble-down on strength (shift →)\\nIt’s often wise to invest more in what’s already working, especially early in a product’s life when it’s hard to have even one thing that is special, or a reason to buy despite its many deficiencies. This only works when customers value the additional investment (i.e. Kano “attractive” or “performance”), but if that’s the case, it might be the most strategic thing you can do.\\nPivot (shift ↓)\\nWhile it’s unusual to jettison a strength, it makes sense if the company is pivoting: Changing its target, or how its brand and product is positioned against the competition.\\n\\nQuadrant C: Speak no evil \\nOften there’s not much in this quadrant, because it’s easier to think of things you’re saying and doing, and these are neither. However, it’s valuable to list “things we know are weaknesses” or “things we’re saying ’no’ to,” especially if it’s a common topic of conversation at the office, or if a competitor is successfully talking and walking that item.\\n\\nDo nothing\\nThis is the correct answer for nearly everything here. It’s expensive and high-risk to turn a weakness into a strength; your energy is probably better spend executing on your current promises and doubling-down on strengths.\\nTurn it around (shift →)\\nIf this is truly a key area that is critical to succeed in the market—which is another way of saying “strategic”—then this is a weakness to highlight, and to invest in. Should you shift it up (start talking publicly) before you’ve shifted it right (pay off the claims)? Probably not: You tip your hand to competitors, allowing them to react before you can defend. You also set incorrect expectations for customers; later when you really can pay off your words, you’ve already trained them to disbelieve you. Conversely, talking first can freeze the market4, but only if your market leadership position is so strong that a press release actually does change market behavior. Unlikely.\\n\\n\\n4\\n “The U.S. District Court … suggested barring Microsoft from making vaporware announcements because doing so can allegedly freeze the market and discourage buyers from purchasing competing products. … ‘I feel very sure there have been many times when Microsoft has announced products to freeze the market, [but] lots of companies have done that,’ Kertzman said.\"—Computer World, 1995\\nQuadrant D: The strong, silent type \\nIf you are excellent, why not get credit for it?\\n\\nDo nothing\\nThere might be a good reason for not making a fuss. It could be a trade secret that you don’t want competitors knowing about (but you could brag that a trade secret is part of the magic that makes you different). It could be “boring” internal operational stuff (but customers might be comforted knowing that you’re operationally advanced, and a tech blog is a recruiting tool).\\nTalk about it (shift ↑)\\nEven if this is a secondary or tertiary message, it’s nice to arm sales with more material, or test it in advertising, or make a landing page for the subset of customers who would be impressed.\\n\\nApplication to competitive strategy \\nTurn the tables on your competition to reveal more insights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nAdding the competition to both charts \\nBuild the Talk/Walk chart for a competitor.\\nPlace a copy of your cards onto their board. There might be a lot in quadrant C (“Speak no Evil”).\\nThen create the new cards that makes sense for them. These prompts help generate ideas:\\n\\nWhat do they emphasize (big or bold font) on their home page, “pricing” page, and “about us” page?\\nWhat main features do they highlight on their “features” page?\\nOn what points do you lose to them in sales? Which are they legitimately great at, versus which are they just really good at selling?\\nOn what points do you beat them in sales? For which do they deserve it, versus which are you just good at claiming?\\nWhat do their customers say about them (e.g. on Twitter or testimonials)?\\nWhat do your customers say about them (e.g. when complaining or asking for features, do they reference the competition?)\\nIf you were making an investor pitch on their behalf, what would you say? How much of that would be true, versus aspirational?\\nWhat cultural or moral principles do they or their founder or their CEO publicly espouse?\\n\\nWhatever new cards you add to their chart, also add to your own chart, even if it mostly creates a pile in quadrant C. This is where it gets interesting.\\nAnalyzing the competitor’s strengths \\nIt’s especially instructive to examine your competitor’s strengths. On your board, highlight the competitor’s Quadrant B cards. Everything here is actionable:\\n\\nQuadrant A: Exaggerating against their strength\\nYou’re both making a claim, but only your competitor is fulfilling that promise. Over time this erodes your brand; potential customers start dismissing you, saying “Yeah, everyone claims to have X, but only P really does X.” You were already claiming something ahead of having it, and now the competitor is exposing your little fibs.\\nBefore you decide to knuckle down and match the competitor strength-for-strength, critically consider whether you want to run a race where you’re starting out behind. Do you have what it takes in long-term will-power, and investment in time and skill, not only to catch up to where they are today, but to where they will be in another year? Will the result of that expensive and risky activity pay off enough to be worth it? Occasionally the answer is “yes,” but usually the answer should be “no, let’s move this card downward—stop making this claim—and instead focus on increasing our differentiating advantages in Quadrant B, where we are the ones in the lead.”\\nQuadrant B: Table-stakes; find the differentiation\\nYou’re both doing well here. Perhaps these topics are considered “table-stakes” for any competitor in the market. That’s not a problem, but neither is it an advantage for you. Table-stakes are important to maintain, but it’s a mistake to over-invest in them at the expense of things that differentiate you, or at the expense of the few key weaknesses that you’re converting into strengths.\\nYour comparative advantages are the cards in this quadrant that aren’t shared with the competitor. Do you have a significant set of those cards? If not, inventing some might be the single most strategic thing you could do.\\nQuadrant C: It’s not your thing, and that’s OK\\nThis is where your competitor is differentiated against you. It’s easy to get discouraged or think this is a problem; it’s not. The only problem is if you don’t have your own unique strengths. If you both have your own strengths, that’s just defines your respective niches, which is useful to recognize.\\nAs with Quadrant A, it’s highly unlikely that you should attempt to “turn it around” and become strong where your competitor is already strong. But, if there’s one item that’s truly important to win, you could set that intention. Just know that you can’t have more than one or two of those at a time, and often you’ll only get to mediocre, not a strength. It surely must be treated as a Rock.\\nQuadrant D: Don’t give them a free pass\\nYou’re letting your competitor take all the credit, even though you’re just as good. Change that! Sure, you’ll probably just match them, not create a new differentiated advantage, but since you’ve already done the work to be excellent in this area, don’t give them an uncontested win in sales calls.\\n\\n\\nI hope this exercise is as useful to you as it has been for us!\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/talk-vs-walk/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you\\'re enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe \"Talk vs Walk\" workshop\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)The methodWrite-storming ideasDebating placement is one-third the valueTaking actionQuadrant A: ExaggerationsQuadrant B: The trusted brandQuadrant C: Speak no evilQuadrant D: The strong, silent typeApplication to competitive strategyAdding the competition to both chartsAnalyzing the competitor’s strengths\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

A person wants to solicit ideas, but ends up getting told which idea is best. A person wants help deciding between two vetted options, but instead receives seven new options.\\nHow can we leverage the wisdom of the crowd, while ensuring that decisions and other responsibilities continue to reside with an individual?\\nSome answers follow. Enjoy!\\nRanting \\nI need to get something off my chest, in a trusted environment, where I can say things that make me vulnerable (e.g. “I don’t know where to start” / “I’m scared to face this”), or might sound frightening to others (e.g. “I don’t think what that other team is doing is right” / “I’m doubting my strategy and I’m worried how my team will react if I broach it”).\\nI don’t want you fix the problem, I just want you to understand the problem. I wouldn’t mind if you supported me while I work through the problem. For example, I have “people problems” in my organization; I don’t need everyone to jump in, but I do need them to “be kind” to my teams while we work through this, and understand that we might need extra time to do our work.\\nThis can lift a great emotional weight off the person, while increasing team cohesion, trust, vulnerability, and empathy, therefore it is a fantastic use of meeting time.\\nIdeation \\nI need ideas. Possible causes of a problem, possible solutions of a puzzle, more options for actions I could take. I’m stuck right now, too close to the problem, and I don’t have ideas, or I’m tired of looking at my ideas and I need new ones. I sent an email about this ahead of time, so the group has had time to think about it.\\nI don’t want you to solve the puzzle or decide which option is best, I just want you to help me see options that I’m not currently seeing. For example, I have a strategic challenge where I need to solve for two apparently-contradictory things, and I need ideas for how that might work. I don’t want you to decide my strategy for me, but help me see more possibilities.\\nEveryone gets stuck; no one can have all the great ideas by themselves. Having a space where ideas can flow but no one is trying to tell you want to do, is fun for everyone and impossible to do alone, therefore it is a fantastic use of meeting time.\\nDecision-Support \\nI need help deciding something. I know what my options are, and I’ve analyzed them (sent ahead to the group), but it’s complex and I’m uncertain which to pick. I might even be uncertain how to decide. It could be that the best option isn’t yet in the list, so it could be good if we synthesize something new. But ultimately I don’t want seven new ideas; I want to make a decision.\\nI don’t want you to tell me what to pick, but I do want input, whether on the evaluation of the options, or on what basis I should make a final decision. I might even ask the room to vote; not to dictate my future, but because I trust the room’s opinion and I want it as another input in my decision process.\\nNo matter how many prioritization articles you read and ROI rubrics you make and multi-dimensional maximization charts you make, complex decisions are difficult. Seeing your choices reflected in others’ experiences and points of view can help, and cannot be done alone, therefore it is a fantastic use of meeting time.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nSparring Practice \\nI need a Devil’s Advocate to sharpen my work. I want find the weaknesses in my strategy, my feature concept, my keynote presentation, my reorg proposal, my new UX design; I need a safe space where people “attack” my work, to surface legitimate flaws, or to reveal ways of making my argument that deflect potential attacks before they begin.\\nI don’t want you do my work for me. If you have an idea for improvement I’d love to hear it, but I will decide what to do with that idea. It’s OK if you “attack” from a perspective that isn’t even accurate, because my future readers might have the same misunderstanding, and I want to be clear even to them. I want to be challenged with the intention of making my work bullet-proof.\\nWhenever you see a brief, tight, bullet-proof document, it took a lot of work to get there. No one by themselves can think of all the ways that others will (mis)interpret ideas, or think of all the legitimately good counter-arguments that deserve answering, therefore it is a fantastic use of meeting time.\\nDeclare the conversation \\nIt’s counterproductive when someone wants a Ranting, but receives a Sparring Practice. Declare what kind of conversation you want, then everyone can participate in the right way, and facilitators can reroute the conversation when it inevitably strays from the parameters of the discussion.\\nThere is an “I” in Team \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice that everything here is selfish—each exercise is about what one person needs.\\nThis is contrary to how we often work together. We say things like “We need to decide on our Q2 priorities,” instead of “Person X will decide the Q2 priorities by Friday, so let’s discuss to ensure everyone is heard, and the best ideas are incorporated.”\\nIt’s healthy for X to seek a consensus, and X often genuinely wants to be influenced by team mates who X trusts and respects, particularly when opinions are unanimous. However, a decision made by “us” is owned by “no one,” when in actual fact it is owned by X. Acknowledging this reality is useful, even as you also—correctly!–spend 98% of the conversation discussing as equals.\\nThis is also a healthy pressure against top-down control, in cases where the decision is supposed to reside in a self-managed and empowered team. That is, suppose person P is responsible for some project, and asks for help in a room containing peers and person Q, who is P’s boss. The right way for the entire room to help P are techniques like the above, where P leverages the brainpower of the room, but stays in command, keeps the responsibility, keeps the autonomy, even with Q present. It is a wonderful experience for a leader to assist without usurping.\\nLet’s put more ideas for constructive meeting activities in a Twitter thread!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/productive-meeting-activities/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProductive meeting activities: Leverage the team, empower the individual\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)RantingIdeationDecision-SupportSparring PracticeDeclare the conversationThere is an “I” in Team\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

The needle didn’t move. “So… do we have enough gas?” “Yeah, we have another hour left, I stuck the tanks before we left.”\\n“Sticking” means plumbing a wooden dowl through top of the wing, into the gas tank, judging the gas level by the height of the resulting wetness. Sometimes the simplest technology is best. Wooden sticks don’t run out of batteries or make you wait forty-seven minutes for a security update.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrust, but verify.\\n—Ronald Regan, repeating a Russian rhyming proverb: Доверяй, но проверяй\\n\\n\\nIt’s not even good enough to just have “two of everything.” If two things both rely on electricity, and the electricity goes out, you lose both. There were two gas gauges; both failed for the same reason. It needs to be differently-implemented as well, like a stick versus a gauge. For example, there’s a normal magnetic ball compass floating in liquid that will work even if other power sources fail, but it’s hard to read as it bounces around from the vibration so it’s good to have another one that runs off suction—air pressure differential between the outside and inside of the cabin—which is stable even when you’re turning the plane in turbulence.\\nGerry would say: “Who’s lying?” Usually your instruments are correct, but sometimes one is lying. Maybe the suction system isn’t working, so you double-checking suction-based dials with the electric-based dials. You stick the tank, in case the gas gauge is lying.\\nThe same lesson applies to our daily life of data and metrics. You think you understand what each number means, and usually you’re correct. But sometimes you’re running out of gas and don’t realize it. I’ve seen this happen for all sorts of reasons: The spreadsheet had a subtle bug in a formula, the analytics JavasScript code was accidentally left off one page, the survey email didn’t get sent to all the customers in the cohort, the database query did/didn’t filter something important, a nightly update script hasn’t been running for three months.\\nA good way to check for bad data is to replicate the airplane dashboard method of deriving the same information in two different ways. Revenue from your billing system compared to cash flows from your bank statements. (Once I discovered our credit card processor was delaying our cash receipts.) Number of active customers from Stripe, and from your User Portal. (Because sometimes a cancellation in one system fails to cancel in another system.) Web traffic from Google Analytics but also another analytics system, or your raw web logs. (If you use five web analytics tools, they’ll all give you different numbers; this could be due to differences in definitions of things like “visit” and “session,” but is that truly all it is?)\\nBesides paranoia, I’ve found another advantage in computing the same data twice: a better understanding of the forces behind that data, and therefore better analysis of how the company operates and how the market is changing. Consider web traffic. There are analytics that tell you where traffic originates (imperfectly, especially with the latest browsers and extensions intentionally obscuring or blocking data), data about your advertising click-throughs, your own raw web server logs, and broad industry data (e.g. Google Trends on how search-traffic for your keywords is changing). They all tell a different story. None has the full picture; all are biased. But taken together, your picture of the world is more complete, and biases might be cancelled through averaging or by paying heed only to the clearest, most consistent trends. If four different sources agree that a trend is happening, then it’s definitely happening.\\nIf a metric is important enough to watch it every day, and to act if its behavior deviates from expectation, then it’s important enough to be double-checked. Both for accuracy, and for completeness of comprehension.\\nIf your dashboard isn’t redundant, you’ll never know… who’s lying?\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/whos-lying/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWho's lying?\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Many algorithms require—or have better characteristics when—any number of independent replicas achieve a single global time-ordering. In particular, it is useful to know that if two events are separated by more than a few seconds in real-time, that they will be correctly ordered, despite replicas having unsynchronized physical clocks.\\nHowever, operating system clocks are undependable and can even move backward. Furthermore, we don’t want to rely on a “master” or central server. Replicas should be able to arbitrarily join or leave a collective without announcement, operate independently, and communicate with each other peer-to-peer, in any pattern.\\nCommon methods to solve the problem either involve custom infrastructure to achieve tight bounds on the behavior of operating system clocks (e.g. Google TrueTime), or some sort of distributed logical clock such as Vector Clocks. The former is unavailable to most of us, especially if we want our code to run in browsers or laptops or non-Google data centers. The latter suffers from unbounded memory requirements and still results in “conflicts” which are resolved arbitrarily or not at all.\\nHere we present an algorithm and Golang implementation that meets the objectives, with no assumptions about the behavior of operating system clocks, without vector clocks, and without central coordination.\\nObjectives & Definitions \\nIt’s useful to establish a few definitions and conventions before describing how we achieve a solution:\\n\\nRT—Real Time—theoretical omniscient “actual” time. Imagine it as arbitrarily-high-precision UTC time exactly synchronized everywhere. This is not a quantity that any replica can compute; it is for algorithmic discussion only.\\nPT—Physical Time—the time reported by the operating system. This is the only notion of “time” that a replica can access.\\nLT—Logical Time—our implementation of “time,” with the properties outlined above and precisely defined below.\\nXT{expression} means “the type of time XT, applied to the replicas or events in the expression.” For example, PT{\\xa0P<Q\\xa0} means “the Physical Time on the replica P is less than the Physical Time on replica Q.”\\n\\nWith this terminology, we can define our assumptions and our requirements for LT precisely:\\n\\nPT is arbitrary. It can move backwards, it does not produce unique values, it might update only rarely, it is never synchronized between two replicas, it can be ahead of or behind RT by an arbitrary and variable amount. The only thing we know is that, over a long duration, it generally increases.\\nLT always increases. Whenever LT is requested, it will have increased since the previous request (regardless of PT’s behavior).\\nIf B happens after A in real-time, i.e. RT{\\xa0B>A\\xa0}, but A and B happen on different replicas:\\n\\nCorrectly ordered in LT when sufficiently time-separated in RT. If RT{\\xa0B-A\\xa0}\\xa0>\\xa0e, where e is a small, bounded constant, then LT{\\xa0B>A\\xa0} also.\\nArbitrary LT order if close together in RT. If RT{\\xa0B-A\\xa0}\\xa0<\\xa0e, then there’s best-effort for LT{\\xa0B>A\\xa0}, but it could be LT{\\xa0B<A\\xa0}.\\ne is small and bounded. e must be small (e.g. 1-2 seconds), and be a constant, not proportional to some state or configuration. e is the time window inside which we accept events that are incorrectly ordered, so we require this window to be small.\\n“Happened-before” relation is always correctly ordered in LT. If A happens, then the two replicas communicate, then B happens, then it is always true that LT{\\xa0B>A\\xa0}, even if RT{\\xa0B-A\\xa0}\\xa0<\\xa0e.\\n\\n\\nSkewed PT on one replica doesn’t skew the behavior of the collective. If one replica’s PT differs significantly from RT, it should still participate properly with the collective; for example it shouldn’t automatically “win” due to the late-skewed PT, or be unable to write a change due to early-skewed PT.\\nLT uses constant memory. Use a fixed number of bits to represent LT, regardless of factors like the number of replicas. (Unlike Vector Clocks.)\\nDecentralized, without “join” or “leave” events. No masters, no central API. Peers can communicate in arbitrary patterns. Peers never need to announce their joining or leaving the collective. There is no list of peers.\\n\\nIt may sound impossible to achieve the goals of LT given that RT is inaccessible, PT lacks all the properties we need, and replicas aren’t synchronized. It’s fun to see how it can in fact be achieved.\\nLT inside a single replica \\nIt might seem trivial to create LT within a single replica, but even that requires an algorithm. Typically the operating system is used for PT, but that can move backwards (e.g. with NTP, with leap-seconds, with manual settings), and is non-unique (e.g. asking for the time in rapid succession often yields the same value from the operating system, due to CPUs being faster than the precision of time), and can drift significantly far away from RT (due to various causes as in these examples).\\nPT will generally increase in the long-run, but we have to “smooth over” the bumps where it is stagnant or decreasing. To do that, we store the “last-seen PT,” and also a counter, and use the following algorithm (plus a mutex for concurrent access):\\n\\nfunc GetLT() {\\n\\tif PT_Current > PT_LastSeen {\\n\\t\\tPT_LastSeen = PT_Current\\n\\t\\tCounter = 0\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\tCounter = Counter + 1\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn {PT_LastSeen, Counter}\\n}\\nLT is ordered first by PT_LastSeen and then by Counter. So, as long as PT increases, we use it, staying hopefully somewhere near RT (more on this later), but if PT does not increase, the Counter ensures that LT still increases.\\nIn the following simulation from our golang implementation, we can see how LT monotonically increases even when PT doesn’t:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe use of a counter also means the precision of PT is not important. Therefore, a performance optimization is to use a recurring timer to update a thread-safe global variable with PT 1-4 times per second, rather than invoking the much more expensive and blocking operating system call to retrieve PT every time we compute LT. With this optimization, we achieved tens of millions of invocations per second even in a Javascript implementation on a typical laptop.\\n“Happened-Before” relation between replicas \\nSuppose an event A happens on a replica P, and then P communicates with another replica Q, sending that event. Afterwards, an event B happens on Q. We want to be certain of LT{\\xa0B>A\\xa0}, even though A’s LT was generated on P and B’s LT was generated on Q. (See diagram below)\\nThe PT of P and Q will differ, and could differ in either direction. If PT{\\xa0Q>P\\xa0}, then we’ll get LT{\\xa0B>A\\xa0} naturally, because the PT component of Q is already ahead of the PT component of P. That’s the easy case.\\nIn the other case that PT{\\xa0P>Q\\xa0}, we have a problem. In the example below, P’s PT is one minute ahead of Q’s. After P sends Q event A with LT{\\xa071.0\\xa0}, Q’s LT is still far behind, which means when event B happens one second later, it is LT{\\xa013.0\\xa0}, resulting in the problem LT{\\xa0A>B\\xa0} even though RT{\\xa0A<B\\xa0}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem: B’s LT isn’t later than A’s LT, because they’re on different servers.\\n\\n\\nTo fix this, we simply set both components of Q’s LT equal to P’s. Q will know to do this, because when P communicates with Q, it transmits its current value of LT. The following algorithm ensures Q will end up with a strictly-larger LT:\\nfunc UpdateLTFromPeer( LT_Peer ) {\\n\\t// Operate on current LT\\n\\tLT_Local = GetLT()\\n\\t// Take the latest LT\\n\\tif LT_Peer > LT_Local {\\n\\t\\tLT_Local = LT_Peer\\n\\t}\\n\\t// Ensure strictly larger than any previous LT\\n\\tCounter = Counter + 1\\n\\t// This is the new local LT\\n\\tSaveState(LT_Local)\\n}\\nA side effect is that Q’s PT_LastSeen will be ahead of its own PT, but that’s fine because Q will just use its Counter until its own PT catches up. Meanwhile, PT{\\xa0B>A\\xa0} is guaranteed, as the diagram now shows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSolution: Q appropriates P’s LT, because LT{\\xa0P>Q\\xa0}\\n\\n\\nFurther discussion and a proof of correctness can be found in the paper that invented this method, in which it is called a Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC).\\nUsing Skew to fix the future \\nAlthough the algorithm above satisfies many of the requirements of LT, it violates the requirement that e be small and bounded.\\nTo see why, let’s extend our example to consider what happens with subsequent events on P and Q. In particular, P generates an event C soon after B (in RT), and then Q generates an event D about thirty seconds after that:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem: PT clock-skew breaks LT ordering of future events C and D, even though they differ by 30 seconds in RT\\n\\n\\nWe’ve highlighted the problem: LT{\\xa0C>D\\xa0}, even though RT{\\xa0C<D\\xa0}. The cause of the problem is displayed in the diagram: Because Q’s PT is so far behind P’s, Q has to use its Counter to increment its LT, but meanwhile P is incrementing its LT using its PT. In fact, every event on P during the minute after P communicated with Q will have an LT greater than every event on Q during the same interval, regardless of their ordering in RT. This is the condition described in our original LT goals where events can be mis-ordered in LT if they happen closer than a duration e. The trouble is, e is too big (it’s one minute in this example) and it’s not bounded (it could just as easily be one hour).\\nThis situation remains even after Q’s PT catches up with the synchronization event. P’s LTs will always have a larger PT component than Q’s LTs, and thus P’s events (within any one-minute time window) will always look like they are later than Q’s in LT, regardless of their order in RT.\\nOne solution is to mandate small PT clock skews, which in turn mandates that e is small. For example, a basic NTP service can keep clocks synchronized to within tens of milliseconds. In this case the effect in our example would still exist, but only inside a tiny time window of tens of milliseconds, not a full minute. That would be acceptable.\\nHowever, our implementation does not assume control over PT. A replica might be a browser or laptop that we don’t control, or a virtual machine that isn’t running NTP. So, we need an algorithmic extension that eliminates this problem of PT clock skew.\\nThe solution is for Q to compute the PT clock skew, and use that as an offset to its native PT to stay reasonably up-to-date with P. This cannot be done precisely, because of the non-measurable and often-variable communication transmission delay between P and Q, and because PT isn’t dependable, but it turns out being precise is not necessary.\\nWhen P communicates its LT to Q, Q computes s\\xa0=\\xa0PT{\\xa0P-Q\\xa0} as the “skew.” As the diagram below illustrates, s will always under-estimate the actual clock skew, because it’s not taking transmission-time d into account. In our example here, the actual clock-skew is 60, but the computed skew is 59 due to the transmission delay d=1.\\nWhen s is positive, Q saves s. The next time PT is computed, Q uses PT{\\xa0Q\\xa0}\\xa0+\\xa0s as physical time. This means Q’s idea of physical time is now only d behind P. This nullifies the problem in our example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSolution: Use an approximation of real clock skew to reduce the time-window of out-of-order LTs\\n\\n\\nIf s is negative, it is ignored; this ensures that clocks that are already ahead do not get even further ahead.\\nAlthough in practice d is not measurable and fluctuates, it is always non-zero, and rarely larger than a few seconds. It is proportional to network transmission time, not proportional to PT clock skew or any other system state or configuration. Therefore we can say that s always under-estimates skew, and by a bounded amount on the order of the replica’s communications delay (i.e. 1ms inside a data center, 100ms across a country, or 1000ms across the world).\\nFinally, observe from the diagram that the time-window in which this problem can occur has been reduced to just 1 second, i.e. reduced to d. Indeed, e from our LT goals is exactly d theoretically, and on the order of d practically, which we just said was less than a few seconds. Thus, we have achieved the objective that e be a bounded constant.\\nWhat happens when all replicas’ PTs are in fact well-synchronized, e.g. with an error less than d, which is easily achievable with well-known algorithms like NTP, or modern phones and laptops that synchronize their clock with GPS? Then the computed skew will be less than zero. To see why, consider that [computed\\xa0skew]\\xa0=\\xa0[real\\xa0skew]\\xa0-\\xa0d, but in this hypothetical, [real\\xa0skew] might be 50ms whereas d is typically greater than that. Negative computed skews are ignored, thus we’ll always have s\\xa0=\\xa00.\\nAlthough this is not a specific requirement on the behavior of LT, it does satisfy an intuitive desire for skew-correction to vanish when it isn’t needed.\\nIf a replica’s PT is substantially earlier than RT, it will develop a large forward skew, neutralizing the problem. If a replica’s PT is substantially later than RT, all other replicas will develop a skew that aligns with it. Therefore, we achieve the objective that significant skews in either direction don’t adversely affect operation of those replicas or of others.\\nStill, a replica with a large PT-RT will create a large skew value for the whole group, with the legal but undesirable effect that PT\\xa0+\\xa0s differs significantly from RT. When that happens, it’s important that skews don’t continue to creep up, with each replica edging the others forward. A non-zero value of d helps; in our implementation we add another 500ms to the effective value of d to ensure this effect.\\nSimulations \\nThe following simulations were generated from our Golang implementation.\\nConvergent LT, with staggered PT\\nWith replicas starting with PT staggered every 10-seconds, one-way-synchronizing a random pair once per second, they monotonically increase and eventually converge on the one with the latest LT.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConvergent LT, with variable-rate PT\\nWith each replica’s PT clock running at a different rate relative to RT, one-way-synchronizing a random pair once per second, all replicas keep converging close to the one with the latest LT, i.e. the fastest clock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFar-Future replica joins, then leaves\\nA replica with a far-future date joins; all replicas converge on the new far-future LT by one-way-synchronizing a random pair once per second. The “bad” replica then leaves the collective. The remaining replicas have large skews, which should not change. In particular, they should not “creep up” in skew.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblems \\nLT at start-up \\nWhen a replica first starts up, it will have an LT that is likely to need skew-correction. It should “fix” its LT prior to using it in a meaningful way.\\nOne fix is to communicate with any other replica; this will bring it up to speed and set an appropriate skew.\\nAnother fix is to persist the LT state between runs of the replica. In particular, saving the skew value. However, this is not as good as communicating with a live replica, because the behavior of PT or the collective value of the skew might have changed since the previous run.\\nUsing LT without doing those things is still legal and self-consistent, but will generate events that will appear to be older than they actually are, relative to other events being generated by other replicas around the same RT.\\nAnti-Objectives \\nThe following are not goals. In some cases the algorithm gives best-effort to achieve them anyway. In some cases there are things the library user can do to opt-into having that goal, possibly at the expense of another goal or constraint.\\nUniqueness \\nThe algorithm above creates locally-unique values (i.e. monotonically-increasing), but not globally-unique (i.e. two replicas can generate the same LT).\\nUniqueness can be useful because it allows LT to also serve as a “name” of an event in logs or databases.\\nIt’s easy to add uniqueness. Just add more (least-significant) bits to the LT structure. Set them equal to something unique to a replica. This can be a replica ID that is unique in the world, since the rest of the Time components will never be generated again on that replica. Or it can be a sufficiently large number of random bits.\\nIt may seem like collisions are already unlikely, however they are common under certain assumptions, namely if PT is coarsely updated and d is very small. Consider the example above, but rather than d=1, assume a fast network where d=0.001 but a PT source that updates only once per second (on a timer, say). Once P and Q share LT, they will be identical at the same point in RT, and stay synchronized thanks to s. So they will likely collide if both generate an LT inside the same RT second.\\nKeep PT close to RT \\nIt’s nice if PT stays close to RT, but it is not a requirement.\\nYou can achieve this, in fact making the difference bounded, if you disable skew. This keeps PT close to RT but results in a potentially large e, and thus you get mis-ordered events. If you accept this trade-off, you can ensure PT never strays too far from RT, as proved in the the HLC paper referenced above.\\nTo achieve this while not giving up the objectives on the small size of e, you can use NTP or a similar service to keep PT close to RT.\\n\\nIn the end, the algorithm is simple, and perhaps even obvious in retrospect.

Though inevitable, change is uncomfortable and exhausting. Manage it with kindness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis plays out in many ways:\\n\\nCustomers demand an improved UX, but they don’t want to learn a new UX, and they always complain when it changes.\\nTeam members want consistency but don’t want policies.\\nDevelopers want to be more efficient but don’t want to change how they work.\\nStrategy is ineffective if it’s constantly in flux, but a strategy that remains unchanged in the presence of new information is incorrect.\\n\\nThe right choice is almost always “change.” This is because change is a reaction to uncovering facts, getting smarter, or a shift in the external environment. Death awaits any organization that chooses the comfort of the familiar over the discomfort of change.\\nYet, though inevitable, change is uncomfortable and exhausting. Even we who relish change, who love bragging that “it’s hard but every day is different,” reach a breaking point after years of adaptation and fake-gleefully exclaiming that “failure is how you learn!”\\nYeah, but all this learning is fricking tiring.\\nThis is important for leaders to understand, if indeed “change is the only constant” as the insipid cliché goes. Even your most stoic, change-loving mortals sometimes need a break from change. Yes “it’s a marathon” but sometimes you need to walk a mile to catch your breath. Look for signs of burnout or decision-fatigue, and address it proactively.\\nThis is equally important for everyone in a startup, whether you manage others or not. Constant change can feel like management has no plan and no strategy. It takes careful consideration to distinguish between being rudderless and a culture of self-reflection and improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that not all change is in fact for the best. Sometimes our attempt to solve a problem makes it worse. Sometimes when we try to make code faster, we break it. The difference is that we can see slow code objectively in the profiler and couch the code in unit tests and code reviews, and iterate before we ship, and revert to the previous version in the worst case; it’s not so easy when the change is happening to a whole team, or a major product release, or a cross-departmental strategic initiative.\\nIn fact, sometimes it’s objectively impossible to know ahead of time, and you have no choice but to place a bet.\\nEven deciding what to change is hard. Successful companies can stall out because they lose sight of the fundamental reasons they earned success in the first place—the key insights and UX of the product, or the key culture and values that attracted their first hundred or thousand employees. But successful companies also stall out because they’re so dogmatic about their strategy or “non-consensus but correct” ideas that when the world changes around them, or scale breaks their previously-correct notions, they fail to adapt. It is not generally true that “what got us here will get us there,” and that means deep change is required.\\nThere’s a mindset that everyone can use to address all of these difficulties:\\nBe kind.\\nMaybe don’t judge too harshly if your organization tries to improve one thing and ends up breaking another, or where the organization takes too long to implement change. Maybe don’t judge too harshly if the person to your left needs to work on something easy for a few sprints or take a vacation.\\nEdison had to try thousands of materials before finding the one that make lightbulbs practical. Would you have judged him for “thrashing?” Invention is often frustrating.\\nYou should judge harshly if nobody is thinking about this. If nobody cares whether there’s change or not, if there’s no rhyme or reason to the company strategy, if everyone is expected to act and feel happy and productive all of the time, then you should definitely judge. An organization that isn’t striving to improve, will rot and disintegrate.\\nThere are no straight paths in life or startups. All we can do is keep being introspective, and keep attempting the right sort of change.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/change/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nChange: Damned if you do, damned more if you don't\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Choose your decision-making goal wisely, especially if you’re a natural perfectionist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Maximizing” means finding the best solution. It requires exploration and analysis to ensure “the best” option hasn’t been overlooked, and that we have confidence in our evaluation of the options.\\n“Satisficing” means picking the first or easiest or least-expensive option that satisfies the requirements. Preferring a faster decision to the best decision. It means not getting paralyzed by the pursuit of “perfect,” but as a result, rarely results in the very best solution.\\nPeople naturally tend to be Maximizers or Satisficers, although it depends on the subject. For example, you might maximize your career, but satisfice your diet.\\nStudies show that although Maximizers make better choices Satisficers enjoy their choices more, and of course spend less time and create less stress in making the choice.\\nYou must choose when to Maximize, and when to Satisfice. It might seem like Maximizing is best, especially when you have teams of smart people who can do the maximizing. But often this is the wrong thing to do.\\nSpeed is one of the greatest competitive advantages, partially explaining why small up-starts are able to beat large incumbents. Speed requires satisficing, not maximizing. Strength in startups comes from shipping, with benefits accruing today instead of theoretical benefits in future, using customer reaction and real data to decide your next move, rather than planning many moves ahead, which you can’t do anyway.\\nSatisficing is also best for “sand” in the “Rocks, Pebbles, Sand” analogy, when deliberation is the enemy.\\nStill, maximizing is best for some decisions, particularly decisions that should be made slowly. Your Product & Business Strategy is a slow obsession, best when taken from many angles, pounding it with devil’s advocacy, questioning every assumption, “sleeping on it” repeatedly, repeating pieces of it to customers, strangers, anyone who might have a useful reaction. Strategy isn’t something you want to change often, with entire teams and careers being built on top of it, so maximization is best.\\nFor the most important decisions, maximize with Binstack. For almost anything else, satisficing is likely wiser. Be careful; the same perfectionism that makes you a force to be reckoned with (and that drives your impostor syndrome) will lead you to maximize too often.\\nFor satisfying activities, define an objective threshold for “what is satisfactory.” When a metric is below its threshold, investment is warranted. Otherwise, you must not continue to invest in it, because definitionally it’s not valuable (enough) to deserve attention, whereas other areas can leverage that investment, either because they’re below their own thresholds, or because they are things to maximize.\\nPick the right goal for each decision, and communicate it clearly.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/maximizing/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSatisficing vs Maximizing\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

But isn’t competitive advantage ruined when competitors know your growth rate and steal your source code?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat would happen if I forced you to put all your precious, proprietary, secret-sauce code in a public Github repository?\\nFor one: You would be judged. Your peers would judge you by that code, with various definitions of “goodness” that includes everything from file and class organization, documentation, tests, eliminating your reliance on “security by obscurity,” tracking to-dos, and even the artful quality nebulously defined as “you know it when you see it.1”\\n\\n1\\n Famously said by US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in 1964 as his criteria for “obscenity,” though in 1972 he was part of a court that created a more specific three-part criteria; in 1981 he said he “regrets having said what I said about obscenity—that’s going to be on my tombstone.“\\nIn this sense, building in public would force you to create quality, artful code.\\nThe force is as simple as it is universal: Ego—your desire to impress others.\\nBut… haven’t you lost your competitive advantage? Your competition can easily copy you, so you’re screwed, right?\\nYou are therefore forced to build some other, non-technical competitive advantage into your business. For example, if Etsy open-sourced their entire stack, would that make it easy for a competitor to overtake Etsy? No, because Etsy has built a marketplace; the presence of buyers and sellers is their primary asset, not the software that drives the website or payments. Now that Facebook has open-sourced their entire data center infrastructure, does that make it easy for a competitor to overtake Facebook as a social network? No. The value in these companies cannot be replicated with money, which is exactly why those companies are valuable.\\nA technical competitive advantage can be permanent in select cases, as in this case study of Amazon AWS. But this is rare; typically a technical advantage is a fleeting advantage, because most technical things can be replicated. In fact, they’re often replicated more quickly and cheaply than their original inventors, as proved by observing that “first to market” often doesn’t equate to “winning the market.”\\nThus, building in public forces you to create permanent competitive advantages.\\n“Building in public” doesn’t just mean software, however. What about the organization, or individual people?\\nIf you publish the salary formula for everyone at your company, you no can longer compete for talent solely on compensation. You can’t kick in an extra $10k/year to win a critical employee with especially germane experience. And it can be weird for everyone to know how much money everyone else makes. But for many people, it’s not weird, it’s fantastic.\\nThis forces you to build a company where great talent wants to work, where people are there for the culture and mission rather than as mercenaries. There are many frameworks that guide you in constructing such an environment, but in general they include Autonomy (i.e. freedom to explore, the control and empowerment to invent solutions to problems, and to prove the quality of those solutions through implementation, in exchange for accountability for the result), Growth (i.e. working on interesting puzzles, whether personal or professional, along a fulfilling journey), and Purpose (i.e. why should this company exist? Why is it worthwhile to bust ass to see it thrive, the culture, the values, the joy of working with others whom you admire).\\nHere is a more comprehensive framework.\\nThus, building in public forces you to create a company with exceptional culture and an organization of empowerment and purpose.\\nWriting code you can be proud of, constructing true permanent competitive advantages, and creating a company culture that attracts and retains top talent for reasons beyond legal bribery—are critical ingredients for creating durable companies whose growth and brand are unhindered by the onslaught of well-funded, hard-working, intelligent upstarts that inevitably join any market big enough to be interesting.\\nBy building everything in public, you’re forced to do “what’s most valuable” as well as “what isn’t easily copyable,” whether that means the quality of your workmanship, the fortress of your business model, or a talent magnet.\\nIt’s still possible, and occasionally advisable, to operate in secret. But sunlight isn’t just the best disinfectant, it’s a great way to forge durability.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/building-in-public/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBuilding in public forces true competitive advantage\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

It’s not just about accuracy. Let’s dive into the math.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s a 30% chance of rain today.”\\nAnd then it didn’t rain. So, was the forecast accurate?\\nOr it did rain. Is the forecast inaccurate?\\nHow do you hold forecasters accountable, when the forecast is itself a probability? The answer appears tricky, but ends up being simple enough to answer with Google Spreadsheets.\\nIt’s a journey worth taking because of the value of building better forecasts:\\n\\nLead scoring: Putting a value on a new sales lead, predicting the chance of converting to sale, and its dollar value.\\nPredicting churn: If you could predict the chance that a given customer will churn in the next thirty days, you could be proactive and perhaps avert the loss; do this enough and you’re on the road to Product/Market Fit.\\nPredicting upgrades: If you could predict the chance that a given customer is amenable to an upgrade, you could focus your internal messaging efforts accordingly.\\nRisk assessments: Establishing better probabilities on risks results in more intelligent investments.\\n\\nSo how do you measure the accuracy of a prediction that is expressed as a probability? Let’s return to the meteorologist.\\nAccuracy Error \\nClearly, a single data point tells you nothing.\\nRather, the correct interpretation of “30% chance of rain” is the following: Gather all the days in which the meteorologist predicted 30%. If the meteorologist is accurate, it will have rained 30% of those times. Similarly, the forecaster will sometimes predict 0% or 10% or 50%. So we should “bucket” the data for each of these predictions, and see what actually happened in each bucket.\\nWhat is the right math to determine “how correct” the forecaster is? As is often the answer in statistics, we can take the squared difference1 between the forecast and the actual result.\\n\\n1\\n Why do we square the errors instead of using something simpler like the absolute value of the difference? There are two answers. One is that squaring the differences intentionally exaggerates items which are very different from each other. The other is that the mathematics of squared differences is much more tractable than using absolute value. Specifically, you can expand and factor squared differences, and you can use differential calculus. Computing a linear regression line with least-squares, for example, is derived by using calculus to minimize the squared differences, but that same method cannot be applied to linear differences. Nassim Taleb is famously against this practice, but let’s not argue the point now.\\nSuppose we have two forecasters, and we ask: Who is most accurate? “Accuracy Error” is measured by the sum of the squared differences between the forecast and reality. Whoever has the least total error is the better forecaster.\\nFor example, suppose on some given set of days, forecaster A always predicted a 32% chance of rain, and B always predicted 25%, and suppose in reality it rained on 30% of those days. Then the errors are:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPredict\\nActual\\nSquared Diff = Error\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\(32\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((0.32-0.30)^2 = 0.0004\\\\)\\n\\n\\nB\\n\\\\(25\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((0.25-0.30)^2 = 0.0025\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt feels like we’re finished, but alas no. If all we compute is Accuracy Error, we fall for a trap in which we easily forecast with perfect accuracy, while also being utterly useless.\\nDiscernment \\nSuppose these meteorologists are in a region that rains 110 days out of every 365. That is, the overall climactic average probability of rain is 30%. A meteorologist would know that. So, a meteorologist could simply predict “30% chance of rain” every single day, no matter what. Easy job!\\nOur Accuracy Error metric will report that this forecaster is perfect—exactly zero over a whole year of predictions. Because, the prediction is always 30%, and indeed on those days it rained 30% of the time: \\\\((0.30-0.30)^2 = 0\\\\) . Except the forecaster isn’t perfect; she’s not forecasting at all! She’s just regurgitating the climactic average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so we see that, although “accuracy error” does measure something important, there’s another concept we need to measure: The idea that the forecaster is being discerning. That is, that the forecaster is proactively segmenting the days, taking a strong stance about which days will rain and which will not. Staking a claim that isn’t just copying the overall average.\\nThere is a natural tension between accuracy and discernment which becomes apparent when you consider the following scenario:\\nSuppose forecaster A always predicts the climactic average; thus A has 0 accuracy error but also 0 discernment, and is therefore useless. Now consider forecaster B, who often predicts the climactic average, but now and then will predict 0% or 100% of rain, when he’s very sure. And suppose that when he predicts 0% the actual average is 10%, and when he predicts 100% the actual average is 90%. i.e. when “B is very sure,” B is usually correct.\\nB will have a worse accuracy error score, but should have a better discernment score. Furthermore, you would prefer to listen to forecaster B, even though he has more error than A. So the idea of “discernment” isn’t just a curiosity, it’s a fundamental component of how “good” a forecaster is.\\nHow do you compute this “discernment?” We once again use squared differences, but this time we are comparing the difference between observed results and the climactic average, i.e. how much our prediction buckets differ from the climactic average, and thus how much we’re “saying something specific.”\\nFor both accuracy error and discernment we use the weighted average for each prediction bucket. Let’s start by computing accuracy error for forecaster B, assuming that out of 100 guesses, 8 times he predicted 0%, 12 times he predicted 100%, and the remaining 80 times he predicted the climactic average of 30%:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBucket\\nActual  in this  bucket\\nAccuracy  Error\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\(0\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(10\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((0.00-0.10)^2 = 0.01\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((0.30-0.30)^2 = 0.00\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(100\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(90\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((1.00-0.90)^2 = 0.01\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we weight the errors by the number of predictions in each bucket, yielding the final Error as the weighted average:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBucket\\nAccuracy Error\\n# in Bucket\\nWeighted  Error\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\(0\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.01\\\\)\\n\\\\(8\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.01 \\\\times 8 = 0.08\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.00\\\\)\\n\\\\(80\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.00 \\\\times 80= 0.00\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(100\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.01\\\\)\\n\\\\(12\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.01 \\\\times 12 = 0.12\\\\)\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\\\(100\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.20\\\\)\\n\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n\\n\\\\(0.20 / 100\\\\)  \\\\(= 0.002\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForecaster B’s accuracy error of 0.002 is still low. Now we’ll compute this new discernment score, which is exactly like accuracy error, except instead of the squared difference between “predicted” and “actual,” it’s the squared difference between “climactic average” and “actual”:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBucket\\nActual  in this  bucket\\nDiscernment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\(0\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(10\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((0.30-0.10)^2 = 0.04\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((0.30-0.30)^2 = 0.00\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(100\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(90\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\((0.30-0.90)^2 = 0.36\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then creating the weighted average, just as with accuracy error:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBucket\\nDiscern.\\n# in Bucket\\nWeighted  Discernment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\(0\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.04\\\\)\\n\\\\(8\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.04 \\\\times 8 = 0.32\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(30\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.00\\\\)\\n\\\\(80\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.00 \\\\times 80= 0.00\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\\\(100\\\\%\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.36\\\\)\\n\\\\(12\\\\)\\n\\\\(0.36 \\\\times 12 = 4.32\\\\)\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\\\(100\\\\)\\n\\\\(4.64\\\\)\\n\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n\\n\\\\(4.64 / 100\\\\)  \\\\(0.0464\\\\)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe might be tempted to conclude “there’s more discernment (0.0464) than accuracy error (0.002), therefore this forecaster is better.” Is that valid? What is the right way to combine these two numbers for a total “goodness” score?\\nTo answer that, it turns out there’s one more concept we need.\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiscernment Error \\nConsider the life of a forecaster in Antofagasta, Chile, where on average it rains only five days a year (for a grand total of 1.7 millimeters of annual rainfall!). At first glance it seems easy to be a forecaster—just predict “no rain” every day.\\nAlthough that forecaster would have low error, she would also be undiscerning. But wait… how could a forecaster ever be discerning in Antofagasta? To be discerning you need to make varied predictions. But reality isn’t varied, so any predictions that were varied, would necessarily be wrong! In a sense, there’s no “space” for discernment, because there’s no variation to discern between. It’s not fair to ask the forecaster to be more discerning than the variation that is actually available to discern.\\nCompare that with forecaster in Portland, Oregon, USA where it rains 164 days out of the year—about 45%. And there’s no “rainy season”—it’s just chaotic. Here even just predicting 55% or 35% here and there could still be highly accurate but increase discernment. And a world-class forecaster has the space to create a significant amount of discernment.\\nSo it’s not quite fair to ask “How discerning is the forecaster?” Instead we should ask “How discerning is the forecaster, compared with how much discernment is even possible?”\\nThe maximum amount of discernment possible, given the climactic average \\\\(c\\\\), is2:\\n\\\\[c(1-c)\\\\]\\nIn general, the closer the climactic average is to 0% or 100%, the less discernment there can be. The maximum possible discernment of 0.25 is available when the climactic average is 50%, i.e. it’s a coin flip.\\n\\n2\\n For the mathematically curious: Maximum discernment happens when the forecast is only 100% or 0%, and when it is completely accurate. If there were \\\\(N\\\\) predictions, the positive case will happen \\\\(Nc\\\\) times, and the negative case \\\\(N(1-c)\\\\) times. Discernment in the positive bucket is \\\\((1-c)^2\\\\) and in the negative bucket \\\\((0-c)^2 = c^2\\\\). The weighted average is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{N}[Nc(1-c)^2 + N(1-c)c^2]\\\\). Factoring out the common \\\\(Nc(1-c)\\\\) and canceling with \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\), we’re left with \\\\(c(1-c)[ (1-c) + c ] = c(1-c)\\\\).\\nIn the 30% example, the maximum possible discernment is \\\\(0.30(1-0.30)=0.21\\\\). Forecaster B’s discernment of 0.04 is therefore not too impressive—plenty of room for improvement. Although still of course B is better than A, who had no discernment whatsoever.\\nIn the case of the desert, with a climactic average of \\\\(5/365 = 0.013\\\\%\\\\), there’s only 0.0128 potential discernment available.\\nIn any case, this allows us to compute a metric that is comparable to error, but for discernment:\\n[Discernment Error] = [Maximum Discernment] − [Discernment]\\nThat is, if you have no discernment, that’s another type of “error”—your forecast is lacking the descriptive power that would come from being maximally discerning. The more discernment you demonstrate, the less of this “discernment error” you exhibit, and the better your forecast is. Just like the less accuracy error you have, the better your forecast is.\\nPutting it all together: The Forecasting Error Score \\nIt turns out3 you can simply add accuracy error to discernment error, and arrive at a rigorous metric:\\n\\n3\\n See “Further Reading” below for the mathematical justification.\\n[Forecast Error] = [Error] + [Discernment Error]\\nOr, writing out each component:\\n[Forecast Error] = [Error] + [Maximum Discernment] − [Discernment]\\nHere’s a way to see why this math works: Every forecaster’s baseline is to guess the climactic average. That will get you a total score of \\\\(c(1-c)\\\\), because you have no accuracy error, but maximum discernment error.\\nFrom there, forecasters will try to deviate from the climactic average. The more they put themselves on the line, the less discernment error they rack up, however they also have to be right! The best forecasters outperform the climactic-average (discernment) by more than the accuracy error they introduce. The overall score tells you who is better. Lower is better, since the score is a “total error.”\\nIt is possible to do worse than the climactic average—to make guesses, but be wrong. You know that’s happening when the total error is larger than the baseline \\\\(c(1-c)\\\\).\\nIndeed, an alternate and equivalent scoring method divides Forecast Error by \\\\(c(1-c)\\\\), to create a metric where 1 means “equal to the baseline,” 0 means “perfect forecast,” and the amount greater or less than 1 indicates proportionally how much better or worse the forecast is from baseline. This has the virtue of the reader not needing to know the value of \\\\(c(1-c)\\\\) in order to understand whether a forecaster is better or worse than the baseline, and by how much.\\nWhile the total score is useful, the individual components of accuracy error and discernment are also useful because they help you analyze what’s going on:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccuracy  Error\\nDiscern\\nMeaning\\nExplanation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n↑\\n↓\\nFailure\\nYou’re not segmenting the population, and yet you’re still worse than guessing the climactic average.\\n\\n\\n↓\\n↓\\nUseless\\nYou’re only accurate because you’re just guessing the average.\\n\\n\\n↑\\n↑\\nTry Again\\nYou’re making strong predictions, so at least you’re trying, but you’re not guessing correctly.\\n\\n\\n↓\\n↑\\nIdeal\\nYou’re making strong predictions, and you’re correct.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow that you know how to measure forecasts, it’s time for you to build some forecasting models. So go try to better understand your customers and prospects, and use this math to know whether iterations of your model are improving.\\nFurther Reading \\n\\nGlenn Brier’s original paper proposing this method in 1950, but without this three-component breakdown that was discovered by Allen Murphy in 1973.\\nBrier score on Wikipedia: A more formal explanation including the three-component breakdown (which are labelled and explained differently from my exposition, but which are mathematically identical).\\nStein’s Paradox: An estimator that’s always better than the historical average, but in a way that apparently can’t be true.\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/forecast/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow to measure the accuracy of forecasts\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Accuracy ErrorDiscernmentDiscernment ErrorPutting it all together: The Forecasting Error ScoreFurther Reading\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Maybe this is why.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuppose a web server is running at 50% of its full capacity. Browser traffic doesn’t arrive in regular, smooth amounts; it comes in spurts and occasionally large spikes. Because the server is under-utilized, when a spike arrives there are spare resources to handle the increase. If the spike is sufficiently large, performance will degrade, and if larger still, many of the requests will be rejected rather than answered; after all, there’s some limit past which the server cannot do any additional work.\\nNow suppose someone looks at a report that shows “50% utilization” and says “Hey now, this is a server, not a person! It costs us the same whether we drive it at 50% utilization or 90% or 99%. So let’s get our money’s worth and drive it into the 90s!”\\nWhat happens? Even normal variations in traffic will drive the server past its capacity. The average time to respond to a request will skyrocket, and often requests will be dropped altogether. Not due to an unusual event, but all the time. The system is now brittle—not good for costs, not good for the quality of the product or customer experience—just bad all around.\\nMaybe we can drive high utilization by having multiple servers work as a team. Suppose we have three servers, all serving traffic for the same website, all at 70% capacity. That sounds like a happy medium between 50% capacity (wasting money) and 90% (brittle). The total amount of utilization is 2.1 servers (3 x 70%), so we’re nicely over-powered for traffic spikes.\\nBut what happens when one server runs into problems? Suppose it crashes, or the power in its data center cuts out, or someone else breaks the network with a glut of garbage traffic. The 2 remaining servers now have to deal with 2.1 servers’ worth of traffic. Both are at 105% capacity, and we’re back to broken and brittle.\\nThis isn’t really about servers; it’s about you and your teams. It’s about how your “busy” life not only diminishes your productivity, but how your whole team is hectic, yet bringing itself to a crawl.\\nWe all have a capacity, whether you want to measure it in hours, in energy, in focussed attention, or if you don’t want to measure it at all. Instead of web-requests, we have life-requests, whether those are inbound emails, Jira tickets, Zendesk tickets, Salesforce leads, requests from co-workers, requests from a friend, or families that need our time and attention even more than they need our paycheck.\\n90% utilization is causing more failure than you realize, not just in burn-out, but in productivity and output. Of course you’ll burn yourself up, sacrificing sleep, health, friends, family, and other things you mistakenly take for granted, but I suppose you knew that already. You’re trading that for super-human productivity, right?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut you won’t even receive outsized professional gains as a reward. This condition is a combination of frequent context-switching and interruption—the Twin Enemies of productivity. Work-completion will drag out because it’s constantly interrupted. Some will be abandoned.\\nWorse, in many organizations everyone is operating at 90%, which then reacts like the three-server system, where the inevitable hiccup from any one person causes a ripple effect that hurts several other people or projects. Since they are over capacity, rather than absorb the spike, they too will ripple the problem to others—a cascade like the the run-away chain reaction of an atom bomb.\\nThe key word here is inevitable. People get sick or die or leave or change or have to run an errand or want to do even one minor piece of work that wasn’t mapped out weeks in advance. True emergencies arise that deserve to interrupt work. This is not something you can “architect out” of the universe; rather, you need to build a system that assumes variation and interruption, and design your personal and team’s work-style to be resilient to that variation.\\nThe ideal is probably a situation where most of the time you’re in the safe zone, with occasional surges into high gear for a short period of time and for good cause. For example, a brand new product launch is usually attended by some extra time fixing bugs, especially post-launch where it hits real customers and a few issues are discovered that we all agree should be fixed swiftly before more customers encounter it. Or there could be a clear-and-present danger to the company that requires a special, time-bounded rally. Or you could use infrequent and brief surges in a fun way, like a Hack-a-Thon or a Bug Squash Competition or a Ticket Kill Day.\\nWe’re erring on the side of over-utilization, and rather than providing the benefits of competitive advantage through higher productivity, it’s creating needless turmoil and lower productivity.\\nDon’t let yourself, or your team, fall into the trap.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/utilization/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYour non-linear problem of 90% utilization\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Is that where you attain happiness and fulfillment? Or are those found right here, right now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEveryone said this would be the most embarrassing moment in the band’s eight-year career.\\nDepeche Mode had decided to play the Pasadena Rose Bowl—capacity 60,000—for the 101st show of their 1988 tour. To sell out would make it one of the largest music concerts ever played in America—highly unlikely for an English electronic band. Claiming they were popular enough to fill that stadium was an audacious act of bravado that critics were eager to see transform to humiliation as they played to a vast, near-vacant space, mocked by the each of the tens of thousands of empty seats.\\nKROQ DJ Richard Blade knew that secretly the band themselves were doubtful. As he sat with singer/writer Martin Gore in the empty stadium before tickets went on sale, Martin “confided in me that he was nervous and hoped they could at least sell out the floor seats—just 10,000 tickets.”\\nBut the show sold out, with paid attendance greater than any Rose Bowl event in the eight preceding years. It was the defining moment of the band’s career—the moment when they undeniably “made it.”\\nAnd yet, simultaneously, one of the saddest moments.\\nAgain from Blade:\\n\\n“Backstage, after their amazing performance, I chatted with [lead singer] Dave Gahan as he cried from pure happiness. He told me that the tears were because he didn’t know if the group could ever pull off anything this great again and for him it was the most emotional concert of his career.”\\n\\nIndeed, they never would pull off anything that great again, even though they increased record sales, wrote more hits, released more albums, played more tours, even reforming the band after the loss of one member and through multi-year battles with drugs, alcoholism and depression from the three remaining members.\\nIt’s true though, what could top that moment? After you’ve proved everything that could be proved, to the critics, to your fans, and even to yourself?\\nWhat does it mean for you or me, that reaching the pinnacle of success is not only strikingly fleeting, but also unhappy? That tears of joy transmute immediately to tears of sadness, because reaching the peak means by definition your next steps must be downhill?\\nThe same thing happens at startups. It’s well-documented that immediately following the “success” of an exit, founders almost inevitably fall into a sadness and even depression, as I’ve written about before.\\nIt could mean this is all for nothing. That our fleeting moment of noon-time glory is cruelly bookended by years of gut-twisting emotional mountain-climbing in the a.m. and a meandering, permanently unfinished quest for meaning and purpose in the p.m.\\nIt does mean this, if you let it. The way you let this happen is to believe that the goal is to achieve a single moment of success—a big sale, going public, or passing it on to your daughter.\\nRather, you must understand that it is the building, not the result of that building, that matters.\\nLet’s break it down:\\nYou spend 99.99% of your time on the journey of building a startup, and 0.01% basking in the temporary euphoria of “success,” such as selling it to someone else or ringing the bell on the morning of your IPO.\\nIf that moment even comes, which it most likely will not. Often 100% of your time is spent on the journey, 0% in euphoric ecstasy.\\nIf you look back and say “That was a wonderful time in my life. I’m glad I did it, and I’d do it again. Sure I would do some things differently—is that not true of anything?—but I’m proud of what I did and I’m stronger and wiser today than ever before. I created terrific jobs, where great people were empowered to build important things together, who were comfortable and safe, who shared in the bounty of whatever upside we could muster, and who themselves would also say they’re personally fulfilled just as I am.”\\nThen you win.\\nBut if your measure of “success” is based on a specific outcome—based on metrics, or money, or growth-rate, or number of employees, or whether you had an exit, or how much money you raised, or how many humans you cajoled into sticking their nose in your app, then mathematically you’re almost guaranteed to fail, but only because of your own definition of failure. You’re guaranteed to spend years of your life in nervous agony, chasing an outcome you think will make you happy instead of making all those years be the years you are happy.\\nThen you lose.\\nDon’t get me wrong—I love making money, I’ve made plenty from previous startups and I hope to make plenty more at WP Engine, and so do our employees (all of whom are shareholders) and our investors. And honoring metrics is part of building a high performing team and building a huge, sustainable enterprise. Nothing wrong with using metrics and money to keep score in this game.\\nKeep score, so long as you can distinguish between the game and life. Keep score, while also basking in the thrill of generating happy customers and launching unique products and gathering the energy and brainpower of brilliant humans tackling interesting problems.\\nIn fact, I’d argue that focusing on the nature of the journey solves one of the great riddles facing all startups. To paraphrase Peter Thiel: the first employee joins because it’s the ground floor of an exciting startup, but why will the 20th person join? Or the 200th?\\nTo be part of the journey.\\nThat’s why you should be there too.\\nIf you value the journey, your “success” is guaranteed.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/success-guaranteed/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe only way to guarantee startup success\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Does that sound like poor quality?\\nThink about the laptops and desktops you’ve owned. Some last longer than others, but it’s probably something like 2-4 years before the OS locks up or a battery can’t hold a charge anymore. Now consider your laptop is idle the vast majority of the time, whereas our servers are getting pounded multiple times per second, 24/7. Even in the wee hours of American timezones when our pan-company traffic dips to its nadir, we’re running malware scanners, off-site backups, and other maintenance.\\nSo, even if our servers are more hardy than your MacBook Pro, they’re taking 100x the beating, so one failure every three years seems pretty reasonable.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows NT crashed.\\nI am the Blue Screen of Death.\\nNo one hears your screams.\\n—Haiku\\xa0from FSF\\n\\n\\nBut remember, we have 1,000 servers.\\xa0Three years is about 1,000 days. So that means, on average, every single day we have a fatal server error.\\nNot to mention 10 minor incidents with degraded performance, or a DDoS attack somewhere in the data center affecting our network traffic, or some other thing that sets pagers a-buzzing in our DevOps team and mobilizes our Customer Support team to notify and help customers.\\n“Well sure,” you say, “that’s normal as you grow. If you had just 10 servers and 100 customers, you’d have much fewer problems and many fewer employees. Today you have more customers, more servers, and more employees. What’s so hard about that?”\\nThe insight is that that scale causes rare events to become common.\\xa0Things happen with 2000 servers that you never once saw with 50 servers, and things which used to happen once in a blue moon, where a shrug and a manual reboot every six months was in fact an appropriate “process,” now happen every week, or even every day.\\nThings as rare as, well, you know…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not only problems that morph with scale, but your ability to handle problems.\\nFor example, a dozen minor and major events every day means 20-50 customers affected every day.\\xa0Now consider what happens as we try to inform 50 customers. For some we won’t have current email addresses, so they don’t get notified. Some of those will notice the problem and create extra customer support load at minimum, but at worst they’ll post on Twitter about how their website was slow or offline today and WP Engine “didn’t even know it.” Then our social media team has to piece all this together, attempt to respond, maybe put together a special phone call with that customer, and so on. Those customers are also more likely to leave a bad review on some review site, compared with the 99.99% of customers who experience no such incident, but also had no reason to decide that “today is the day I leave a good review.”\\nOr consider the scale-ramifications of on-boarding 1,000 new customers a month. In that case, it’s likely that any given server issue will affect a customer who has only been with us for a month or two. Thus the issue causes a “bad first impression,” which is harder to address than a customer who has been with us for three years and therefore has built up a bank account of patience.\\nSo, rare things being common isn’t just difficult from the operational side, but also when you try to handle those problems with customers or other downstream consequences, causing much more work to solve than when the company was small.\\nThe usual response to this is “automate everything.”\\nAs with most knee-jerk responses, there’s truth in it, but it’s not the whole story.\\nSure, without automated monitoring we’d be blind, and without automated problem-solving we’d be overwhelmed. So yes, “automate everything.”\\nBut some things you can’t automate. You can’t “automate” a knowledgable, friendly customer support team. You can’t “automate” responding to a complaint on social media. You can’t “automate” the recruiting, training, rapport, culture, and downright caring of teams of human beings who are awake 24/7/365, with skills ranging from multi-tasking on support chat to communicating clearly and professionally over the phone to logging into servers and identifying and fixing issues as fast as (humanly?) possible.\\nAnd you can’t “automate” away the rare things, even the technical ones. By their nature they’re difficult to define, hence difficult to monitor, and difficult to repair without the forensic skills of a human engineer.\\nDoes this mean all our customers have a worse experience? No, just the opposite. Any one customer of ours has fewer problems per year now than a year ago, because we’re constantly improving our processes, automation, hardware, and human service. It’s when you look across the entire company, and the non-linear additional effort it takes to not just improve the average experience, but to manage the worst-case experience, that you appreciate the difficulties.\\nDoes that give high-scale companies like WP Engine an excuse to have problems? No way! In fact, if we’re not constantly improving on all fronts, the scale itself will catch up and overtake us, so we have to adhere to the laws of automation and diligence even more than smaller, slow-growing ones.\\nBut for those of you in the earlier stages of your companies, when you project 5x growth coupled to just 5x the costs (or only 3x the costs because you’ll get cost-savings at scale), you’re guessing low. When you show 5x growth in projections but don’t budget for new hires in areas like security, technical automation, specialized customer service areas, and managers and executives who have trod this path before and come battle-hardened with play-books on how to tackle all this, you’re heading for an ugly surprise.\\nAnd with high growth, the surprise appears quickly, and recovery means acting twice as fast again to claw back ahead of the effect.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/scale-rare/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRare things become common at scale\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Here’s why.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Always raise more money than you think you need.”\\n—people asking you to take their money\\nActually, they’re right. It’s not a ruse devised by greedy vulture capitalists vying for extra points of equity.\\nYou do need more money than you think. Why?\\nToday you have a business plan, featuring a plausible growth trajectory (neither too conservative nor too optimistic), and an associated cost structure to drive signups and service customers. It costs money to acquire a customer, but takes time for the monthly revenue to cover those costs, therefore costs rise faster than revenue, so you need a cash investment to fund that growth. Your projected cash low-point is $X, thus you need to raise $Y, not just to service the operational cash requirements, but to de-risk the company with additional investments you couldn’t otherwise afford to make.\\nBut what if, nine months from now, revenue isn’t growing quite as quickly as planned? You still signed that 5-year office lease, hired support, sales, and engineering, and brought in training, a comptroller, and a business operations person. Marketing is over-spending to try to kick-start growth. You’re burning more money than you expected, but the correct course of action is to forge ahead and let revenue catch up, not fire half your team and retreat. So, you’ll need more money than you planned.\\nBut what if, nine months from now, revenue is growing more quickly than planned? You scramble to hire ahead in support, sales, and the additional demands on engineering. You trade money for speed—recruiting, contractors, office space, finance. You incur customer on-boarding costs faster than planned, so although in the long-run your revenue will more than make up for it, right now these unexpected new customers cost much more than their revenue contributions, and cash reserves plummet. So, you’ll need more money than you planned.\\nThe only way you need the actual amount of money you thought you needed, is if everything in the next 18 months goes exactly according to plan—a deviation in either direction means you need more money.\\nYou’re delusional if you think you can predict your startup’s finances 18 months out with precision! Which is totally OK—you’re not supposed to.\\nBut not raising “more than enough” money means you’re denying that reality, and therefore causing a time-pressured cash-crunch for yourself 9-12 months from now. That’s irresponsible.\\nAs Douglas Hofstadter says:\\n\\nHofstadter’s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.\\n\\nSimilarly:\\nA business always takes more money than you expect, even when you take this fact into account.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/more-money/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMore money if you do, more money if you don’t\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

How much time do you have, regardless of partitioning?\\nFrom your 24-hour daily allotment, the 1950s-style break-down is 8 hours for work, 8 for home and commute, and 8 for sleep and ablutions. So, “work” and “home” are the two things in which you can spend 40+ hours per week.\\nThis is the amount of time it takes to tackle something huge. A career. A parent. A startup.\\nThere are weekends and vacations and sick days and such, but those don’t add up to enough concentrated time to carry off something like a startup without causing work or home to suffer.\\nOf course “work” and “home” are just placeholders for “Big Things.” If you’re unattached, “home” doesn’t occupy significant time.\\nThe rule of life is: You can have two “Big Things” in your life, but not three.\\nBig Things include:\\n\\nJob\\nKids\\nSpouse\\nSocial Life\\nMajor Hobby (e.g. build a boat in the garage, become a chess master, video game addiction)\\nStartup\\n\\nYou can do a startup on the side while you have a day job, but your family will never see you. You might even lose your family. It happens. This is partly why it’s easier to start a company before you have a family or even a spouse.\\nYou can have a job and a social life, but unless your spouse is fully integrated and agreeable to that social life, there will be strife. “Going out with the guys again?”\\nYes, “kids” and “spouse” are on the list separately. Young kids strain marriages because there’s not enough time to invest in the kids as well as be there for each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome people try to “have it all.” Men and women both. But it’s never true. At most two can function well; the rest do not. More often, there’s just one that receives the majority of the energy, and the rest suffers.\\nNote that “Sleep” isn’t on the list of options, even though it’s mathematically the same in terms of time commitment. That’s because cutting out sleep doesn’t work—then you can’t function at a high level at anything.\\nNo, you are not an exception. That’s egotistical self-deception. Not on sleep, and not on the number of Big Things. Ask the people around you if they think you’re not failing at one of your Big Things.\\nTime to decide which two.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/two-big-things/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou can have two Big Things, but not three\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

But “not selling” might be worse. Maybe my story will help you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy fingers trembled as I fed page 34 of 72 into the fax machine, deftly pressing the head of each page into its creaky jaws one at a time so that this shitty cheap machine wouldn’t snag two pages at once, slantways, obscuring the precious scribblings adorning the footer of each page where it read: “Seller’s Initials: ______”.\\nThis is what the last six years were all for. All the labor. All the risk. The brave face for the troops. The self-inflicted unflagging optimism despite little supporting evidence. All those sleepless nights worried about making payroll with a one-time revenue business model where every month you have to find new revenue from new customers. The 10,000 deliberate hours of becoming an expert in something. The experience you get just after you need it. The hard lessons you occasionally glean from experience. The inner doubt suppressed for the morale of the team. No salary followed by low salary. The “eat what we kill” mentality. The scrounging and scrabbling and begging and fighting the assholes for those morsels of revenue, those crumbs of validation.\\nIt’s over. We did it. I did it. American dream? Check.\\nThe 73rd page spat out confirming the successful transfer of the previous 72.\\nAnd then… sadness.\\nA profound sadness. Not depression—not hopeless or rudderless—but a pure sadness, when your lungs sink into your belly, the punch-in-the-stomach of discovering your dog was hit by a car or that your dad is terminally ill.\\n“What the fuck?” I thought, “Why am I feeling this? I’m supposed to be feel… happy? I guess? Something other than this.”\\nAlmost all startup founders experience a deep and prolonged sadness after selling their company, even when the sale is an outrageous success. Why?\\nThe answer is important and fundamental for all startup founders, whether or not they intend to sell their company some day.\\n\\n\\n“I sell my artwork on Etsy. Want to see?\"—Barista at an Austin coffee shop\\n\\nIf you ask her, “Who are you?” She would answer: “I’m an artist.”\\nIf you ask her, “What do you do for a living?” She would answer: “I’m a barista, but that’s just my day job. Want to see my artwork?”\\nIs she a barista because she pours coffee for money? Is she a driver because she drives a car to work? Is she a maid because she cleans her own apartment?\\nNo, she’s an artist because that’s what she really is. “Barista” is one of many necessary means to the ends, where the “ends” are the basic human needs, followed by creating art, I guess with some Maslow layers in-between.\\nA startup founder lacks this distinction between personal identity and work identity, and this is the key to the “sale-blues” phenomenon and other behavior.\\nA startup is the founder’s personal identity. Startups are not something you do to make ends meet or a “necessary evil” en route to what you “really” want to do.\\nA startup is an obsession. You do it because you couldn’t stop yourself. Because when you were doing anything else, you were thinking about it. That is the mark of “who you are.” Interviewers ask me “Why did you decide to do a second and eventually a fourth startup?” And the answer is “For the same reason that I started the first one—because it’s in my DNA and I have to do it.”\\nWhat do you do in your spare time when you have a startup? What spare time? This is all your time. It’s not just the last thing you think about before falling a sleep, it’s the thing that won’t let you sleep. It’s first thing that trickles into your brain in the morning like The Matrix patterns filling the void.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s why you can weather the painful thoughts like the ones whistling through my ears while I fed legalese into a rickety fax machine. You are consumed, this is your life, this is you. There’s no room for anything else.\\nWhen you sell your company, others are quick to throw jabs like “So, you sold your baby?” Which means: “You’re a sell-out.” (Or: “I’m jealous.” Or both.)\\nIt’s less like selling your baby and more like selling your own identity, now left with finding a new one. If there is a new one, and there’s no particular reason to think there will be. Which is part of the fear.\\nSpeaking of babies, this all sounds a lot like “baby blues”—depression caused by elevated levels of the enzyme monoamine oxidase A—that 70% of women experience after giving birth. A third of those women will experience this for up to a year (postpartum depression).\\nIt’s characterized as a feeling of loss and of mourning, which is seemingly at odds with the arrival of a new life which is just the opposite—gain and celebration. This intellectual dissonance creates secondary emotional effects, specifically the devastating belief that “I must be a bad mom for being sad that I have a new baby.”\\nAre the baby blues the same emotional effect as selling a company? Maybe not—I already don’t like saying “a startup is like a baby.” Besides, postpartum depression is triggered by the arrival of responsibility and, if you insist on the baby/startup analogy, selling your company is the departure of responsibility.\\nBut one thing that definitely is the same is that “feeling of loss and mourning.” A piece of yourself has been eviscerated, irrevocably.\\nThis is not only a normal feeling, it’s by far the majority case. In a high-quality study from Columbia Business School, out of 22 entrepreneurs who sold their companies, every one of them experienced this effect. Some refocussed the energy into the Next Thing (almost always new ventures), but most took years to find that thing which could replace not only the excitement but identity, and many still haven’t found that Next Thing at all. Many wished they could have their companies back; a few did buy them back.\\nSelling their companies forced them to answer a difficult question: If you could do anything, what would you do? What’s really important to you, as opposed to a job? What do you really want to be when you really grow up?\\nThe problem is, the startup already was that thing! It’s a grinding, batshit-crazy, risky, irrational, epic adventure. You wouldn’t have done all that in the first place if that wasn’t already the thing you wanted to do. A startup is never the easiest career path.\\nDoes this lead to the conclusion that selling a startup is the wrong choice much of the time?\\nNo. And this is perhaps an ever sadder realization.\\nIt’s an easier decision if you’re saying “I can’t wait to start the next thing” but perhaps you’re thinking “I don’t know what I’ll do with myself.” You must resist the urge to believe that getting millions of dollars will make you fulfilled, or happy. “Money doesn’t make you happy” is cliché because it’s true. You need to understand how to be fulfilled regardless.\\nBut all that doesn’t mean selling is wrong.\\nJust like a bad relationship that has to be ended even though it will be painful, especially if you genuinely love the other person: Just because it’s painful doesn’t mean you don’t need to do it.\\nBuilding a company in year-one is completely different than building that company through year-five or -ten. The CEO’s job description changes over time, and so does the company, whether you sell it or not. Are you emotionally prepared for this as well?\\nAre you OK with innovation taking a back seat to developing scalable, mature processes? Are you OK releasing control in day-to-day operations to managers, and then releasing control of the managers to your executive team? Are you OK wresting yourself out of Visual Studio, out of Adwords, off the website, off the live chat, out of the sales calls, trusting your managers and not being that sort of meddling micro-manager boss that you yourself hate? Are you OK shouldering the burden of the livelihoods of dozens or thousands of families rather than “pulling 90 hour weeks” to push some code out the door with a co-founder, which now seems easy in comparison?\\nThe fact is, successful startups grow up. They grow into businesses and mature into sustainability, risk-avoidance, HR law, strategic planning, executive meetings, and all that. The founder-CEO is still steering the ship but it’s a different sort of ship.\\nWhat to do? I wish the answer weren’t “it depends” or “every choice is a path of pain,” but often that’s what it is.\\nIn my case, it changed over time. At Smart Bear I didn’t want to lead a huge company. I didn’t want to relinquish Eclipse and my ability to check in code. I didn’t want to manage managers or figure out what changes, strategies, hirings, products, marketing, and sales were needed to make $100M/year. So for me I sold at a good point: before I needed a C_O, but after the company was big enough to garner enough money to cross the Freedom Line.\\nNow at WP Engine, I have new ambitions and inclinations. I am now that CEO1 who manages managers, who sets vision and direction but not day to day operations, who worries about company culture but who doesn’t have SSH access to all the servers, and who is driving towards a company with products and a market and a team which we believe can indeed generate $100M/year2.\\n\\n1\\n Editor’s note: Written in early 2013, later that year the wonderful Heather Brunner joined as our CEO, still leading the company 10 years later, as what I’ve since called a “late-joining founder.“\\n2\\n Editor’s note: It did, at hyper-growth velocity.

Here’s what to do instead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t remember how many times at Smart Bear I tried to sell our main product Code Reviewer with the argument that it “saves you money.” Some customers demanded it in the form of an ROI spreadsheet. So we gave it to them.\\nThe argument makes sense (though it’s wrong). Code Reviewer is tool which helps software developers review each other’s work, just like an editor of a book. It cuts the time of a code review in half—maybe better—because it eliminates busywork. We even lead with that in our one-pager (because back in 2004, sales calls were in person, and one-page leave-behinds were useful):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe economics are obvious: If two developers would each normally spend an average of 30 minutes on a code review, once a day, that’s 20 hours per month. At a fully-loaded developer cost of $150/hr, that costs you $3,000/mo. Code Reviewer cuts the time in half, which means you save $1,500 every month.\\nCode Reviewer costs $499/developer—one time1—so you make your money back with the first month! After that it’s gravy… all the way to the bank.\\n\\n1\\n Ah, the days before SaaS, when all software was “lifetime,” though you’d attempt “maintenance and upgrades” sales in future years at 20% of the original price. Life is better now.\\nYou can’t afford not to buy it, right?\\nBut this argument never worked, not once, even though the reasoning is sound and customers requested it. The reason is that these “savings” aren’t how budgets actually work.\\nIn a perfect world, if the software development organization really did produce more, higher-quality code, that’s undeniably valuable. But it’s also essentially impossible to measure, and is in fact not measured. So the “savings” are invisible, even if real.\\nOn top of that, budgets are siloed; the “Salaries” budget is separate from the “Tools” budget. Never once in my seven years selling software at Smart Bear, whether 10 seats or 2500 seats, did a company make a decision in which savings in the “Salaries” budget resulted in an increase to the “Tools” budget.\\nWith Code Reviewer, the customer buys because they genuinely believe it makes their team more productive, even though they cannot in quantify ROI. Spreadsheets are worthless—they either believe, or they don’t.\\nAs the startup founder, what do you do about this?\\nFirst, create so much value2 that there’s no need to “compute” it. If so-called pay-back period really is less than a month, it’s obvious. Change someone’s workflow so drastically for the better that they can’t live without it whether it’s saving money or not. Improve your customers’ marketing campaigns so obviously and drastically that they don’t need a spreadsheet to understand its value.\\n\\n2\\n more leads, more sales, faster code, efficiency, time-savings, cost-savings, delight, corporate brand, personal image, societal impact\\nSecond, price according to ability and willingness to pay and the structure of your business model, rather than as a direct function of so-called “value.” The software development department has a budget for tools, and different companies have different ways of arguing internally for expanding that budget—you have to match those constraints. The marketing department might be willing to pay for services but not for tools.\\nIn any case, rarely is a simple “cost savings” equation the way you’re going to win sales or set prices.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/roi-selling/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n“ROI” is the wrong way to sell your product\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

Or: A celebration of new life\\n\\nby Jason Cohen on July 17, 2012\\n\\n\\n\\nA startup is a crucible – a fiery place that tests your limits, not by probing them but by violently exceeding them, all of the time. It’s worth it.\\n\\nWhat was supposed to happen is that a curious pair of scissors would be offered me, designed for a singular purpose: to sever the life-line of an infant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI would then have to make a choice—a choice already pondered—on whether I had the stomach to take that critical action myself, in a modern existence where even the most precious and basic of life’s occurrences might be cause for ill-at-ease at the smell of blood or the realities of birth.\\nOf course I would do it; I had practiced that desire.\\nBut I didn’t get the chance.\\nMy introduction to my daughter began and ended with a sterile view of a sterile hallway. Mom had been put under and, in the self-styled “1st-world” country of the USA, the male component of the mated pair isn’t allowed to accompany the female component in anything termed an “operating room,” lest said male faints at said smell of said blood or at sight of said scissors and the hideous yet necessary things done to said female, and who would therefore require medical attention in his own right.\\nSo I sat there, seeing nothing but a beige wall, more helpless than I’ve ever felt.\\nMom was interred in the first place because that cord had wrapped around Abby’s neck causing an erratic heartbeat. Off she had been rushed in a cloud of enscrubbed personnel. Off I had rushed after them, but been planted in a chair, all events invisible and out of reach.\\nThen I heard the cry. Abby’s first breath. A new life. And I wept.\\nMinutes later I was bathing our new girl.\\nLater came something even more miraculous than birth—they let two obvious amateurs take this infant home. Without so much as a pop quiz.\\nWe didn’t know what to do next, but it turns out not to matter as much as you’d think.\\n“Abigail” is Hebrew for “Father’s Joy.” (אביגיל)\\nPeople compare building startups with having children. Could that be right?\\nBoth spend the first two years of life trying to kill themselves, while you frantically run around doing everything possible to prevent it.\\nBoth are a combination of your own creation and their own direction. They’re malleable in certain ways and stubborn in others. Every one is different, even when created by the same parents. Each needs the freedom to find their own way, even if aided and shaped by loving guides. They go through macro-level stages which are predictable and obvious to those who have trod the path before, but also micro-level stages unique to each creation.\\nHow much time do they take? All of it.\\nHow much patience do they take? All of it.\\nOf course they’re not actually that similar, humans just like to draw comparisons. After all, a kid will grow up pretty much no matter what; a startup usually dies regardless of and often due to the actions of the founders, for myriad reasons.\\nI think drawing comparisons is not only unnecessary but useless. Even supposing these two endeavors were similar…. so what? What would you do differently tomorrow?\\nBut one thing both share is not only important, it’s one of those things in life which alters your being in a way that can never be undone, forever changing who you are and how you interact with the world.\\nBoth are a crucible.\\nMeaning, a fiery place that will test your limits, not by probing them but by violently exceeding them, all of the time. A newborn feeds every three hours and one like ours takes an hour to fall asleep between those hours. Ours had colic, in which means she screamed for 12 hours a day, every day, for three months. Try doing that while retaining your sanity.\\nI distinctly remember holding Abby out at arms length, thinking, “This is why they say ‘Don’t shake a baby.’” Until that moment I thought that Public Service Announcement was hilarious—who would throttle an innocent 7-pound newborn? Oh, it’s me. I would have.\\nThere’s only a few times in my life where I’ve been taken to the brink, physically and mentally. Aside from Abby’s colic, all of them have been in startups. You’ve already read pithy Tweets about the “roller coaster o’ emotions,” you’ve wondered whether you have the fortitude to quit your job, and you’ve read books like The Dip1.\\n\\n1\\n Know when to quit so you don’t waste your time, but don’t quit when it’s hard because winners push through the pain.\\nYou’ve read the words, now you see that they’re only words. Words that don’t help much, not really. You have to live it.\\nJust like having kids, you won’t understand until you do it. But if you do it, even if you “fail,” you will come out stronger than you could have ever been without it. Stronger, wiser, ready for the next thing, never able to go back to being a cog, eyes opened.\\nI’ve never met a person who tried a startup, failed, and said they wouldn’t have done it all over again. Never. What does that mean?\\nWe didn’t kill her, by the way. And so (like a startup) although each day can feel like an interminable mixture of necessary drudgery and constant invention. Like sitting up, and walking, and on and on, all boring and inevitable and yet precious and impossible.\\nAnd eventually they don’t need you anymore, or so they claim. Maybe they’re even right.\\nWhat’s your crucible? Where’s your child-like combination of wonder and determination, and the thing that is so difficult, you’re sure you can’t do it, and yet, you do it?\\nBecause that’s how you really live a life, instead of watching life elapse.\\n\\n\\n\\nAwake my little ones, and fill the cup,\\nbefore life’s liquor in its cup be dry.\\n—Omar Khayyám\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/startup-life/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat a startup does to you.

Even after twenty customer interviews? So often people tell you nice things to your face, but really they’re not going to buy.\\nHow do you know when to give up and try a different idea?\\nThe usual answers: It’s a balance. Trust your gut. But your gut is wrong so trust data. But you don’t have data so trust your gut. Don’t give up just because it’s hard. If it’s hard it’s not a good fit. Don’t listen to the haters. Haters have something to teach us.\\nFollow this formula. The formula says there’s no one formula. The formula is to ask “the right” questions. The formula doesn’t know what to do with the answers. It’s different for everyone.\\nUntil recently I haven’t had a good way to explain my idea of the answer. But recently I was rereading Feynman’s Lectures on Physics and, in one of those brief flashes of comprehension that comes when your mind is wandering yet active, I stumbled across the explanation.\\nFluid dynamics is famously complex and incalculable. Consider the drag on this Harrier jet—the force of the swirling currents pulling it backward as it crashes through the air, around curving surfaces, every bump and rivet along the wings and body, twisting and colliding with itself. It’s so chaotic, even modern simulators can’t model it perfectly, and we have to resort to wind tunnels, where we ask the universe to just tell us the answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: NASA\\n\\n\\nGiven this complexity and chaos, it is astounding that the force of drag on an airplane can be approximated as proportional to the square of its velocity. That is:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\[F_{\\\\text{drag}} = Cv^2\\\\]\\nHow could such a simple formula summarize such a fantastically complex process?\\nHumans love this sort of thing—emergent simplicity from complex chaos. There’s beauty in its brevity and power in its utility. We love it so much, the urge is in constant overdrive, and we see patterns and meaning even when there’s none.\\nWe’re tempted, therefore, to call \\\\(F_{\\\\text{drag}} = Cv^2\\\\) a “law”—a rule by which a mere human brain can get a handle on a phenomenon too complex for the fastest supercomputers.\\nBut it turns out it’s not a law at all. It’s not power, it’s a tenuous coincidence, and not one of great utility.\\nHow do we know this?\\nBecause as soon as we try to understand similar situations using this law, it breaks down. If the airplane is flying slowly, it becomes completely inaccurate. If the airplane flies very fast it’s wrong again. If we make small perturbations on the wing the constant can change dramatically. Perhaps most surprisingly, if you physically remove one of the wings, that changes the drag on the remaining wing.\\nThere are forces inside and outside the aircraft, hidden to a casual observer, uncaptured by simple formulas.\\nWhere is all this in our “law?” Nowhere. If we step outside our little safe space, the law crumbles. It’s not a fundamental law, because it does not predict what happens in novel situations.\\nContrast this to another so-called law—Conservation of Energy—which states that the total energy of a system is constant. So if a ball falls in a gravitational field, it loses potential energy while gaining kinetic energy, such that the total energy never changes.\\nIs this a true “law?” How can we tell?\\nWe can make a complex series of ramps inside a vacuum, starting a ball at different heights and positions and letting it roll down and up and around, measuring the velocity the whole time. We find that the ball’s speed everywhere exactly ensures the two energies remain equal, regardless of the configuration of the ramp. This feels powerful—even in an arbitrary configuration, the law still accurately predicts the result.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a real ball and a real ramp, friction slows the ball, thereby reducing total energy and therefore a violation of law! Ah, but we realize that “heat” is also energy—something we can measure and convert into other forms of energy—and when we measure the increase in heat in our experiment (in the ball and in the ramp) we find that the energy due to heat exactly replaces the energy lost as the ball slows, and again our law is correct. In fact, our law predicts how much heat, and we find exactly that amount, so now the law has just predicted the existence of new kinds of energy, and did it accurately, which is even more impressive!\\nThen from other experiments we learn that matter is in fact composed of gargantuan quantities of tiny objects, moving and colliding and vibrating. That suggests a different definition of heat itself—that it’s not a “new” form of energy at all, but rather the total kinetic energy from jiggling particles! Under this hypothesis we can make definite predictions about how much energy heat contains, how heat and particle density and pressure would have to change in a gas under various conditions, and so on, all on the sole basis that energy must be conserved, and in fact those predictions all prove accurate!\\nEven in the modern era with Relativity bending and weaving time and space, and Quantum Mechanics so strange that Feynman himself said that no one really understands it, still the conservation of energy has always been found to be perfectly correct.\\nWith the drag-force equation, the deeper we dug the more we discovered that the “law” doesn’t encompass much truth; with the Conservation of Energy we found that the closer we look and the more we stretch ourselves the more powerful the law becomes, the more applications we have for it, the more predictions it makes, and that is the characteristic of a bona fide Fundamental Law of the Universe.\\nTruth in startups converges or diverges in the same way.\\nSpecifically, before I validated the ideas behind WP Engine, I validated another idea for a startup. The key thing to notice is that during my customer development, everyone said “That’s a great idea, you should do it!”\\nEveryone.\\nExcept, as I dug in with each person, the “truth” started diverging. One said I should target enterprises, charging $1000/mo and selling through consultants. One said I should make it freemium and figure out how to make money converting 5% to $5/mo. Another said charge a minimum of $50/mo to cut out the moochers who email support but don’t pay for stuff. Another said the small-to-mid-sized business market is the untapped niche. One said I should use it to measure online ads and forget about measuring leads; the next said I should use it to feed leads into Salesforce and forget about measuring marketing efforts; the next said I should use it to reveal marketing efficacy and not try to close leads.\\nLike the airplane law, I had discovered something intriguing, even exciting, but not something fundamental, not something with clear steps forward, not a Venn Diagram of ideas creating a large, dark area scintillating with lumps of variation, but rather a blotchy Venn Diagram with twenty lobes of dissonance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut my experience vetting WP Engine was convergent. The more people I spoke with, the more agreement there was over the pain they had, whether my solution was an acceptable, and the the amount they were willing to spend. $50/mo to make a WordPress site fast, scalable, secure, and when tech support answers the phone, they should be knowledgeable about WordPress. Kick in a staging area and backups and it’s a done deal. Thirty of forty people agreed to sign up during their interview. (Twenty of the thirty later did, and we launched with a total of thirty customers. More of the story is here.)\\nI had found the startup equivalent of a fundamental law—not an immutable physical law of course but something that behaves like truth—where multiple areas of inquisition lead to a common destination instead of leading to different planets.\\nOf course there’ll be no rubric to determine whether an idea is tenable or whether the situation is so bleak that you should give up. But in my experience this feeling of convergence or divergence is very strong if you’re being introspective and honest with yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour hardest battle is indeed with yourself, as you’re constantly tempted to bias the evidence in the most convenient direction (validation), and your fear of figuring out that your pet idea, while undeniably cool, is not a business, in that other people are not going to give you money for it.\\nJust remember how expensive it is to stay ignorant. Your project will meet the same, bitter end, only after a significantly larger investment in time, money, heart, and reputation.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/good-startup-ideas/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe “Convergent” theory of finding truth in darkness\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

It just seemed extraordinarily dull where nothing was happening, and then nothing happened, and then it ended. The teacher asked us what it meant; no one volunteered an answer. I piped up: “I really don’t know. I’d like to know but I don’t.” The teacher wasn’t happy. The teacher’s pet said the same. The teacher was so disgusted with our lack of insight that she never did tell us the answer.\\nSince I never learned to write well—persuasively, with entertainment, with interest—I learned by copying.\\nNot plagiarizing—that’s when you use someone else’s words. Rather, I tried to copy style. By copying I learned what I liked, what I had some ability to do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nPasting style, not text.\\n\\n\\nFor example, in Hello, I’m 1074018628, a little ditty from 2008, I copied Seth Godin’s style. It’s 160 words. It makes a simple, solitary point. It runs right from specific example to overarching lesson bordering on a morality tale. At the end you’re left inspired to improve yourself, and by extension improve the world.\\nExcept… when you think about how to implement your newfound inspiration, you have no tools. The example is apt, but then again you’re not that bad—you don’t mail-merge numbers in MailChimp. And when you’re trying to be creative and innovative, you realize that “not shitty” isn’t a goal. So then you re-read the post looking for guidance for how to be extraordinary, but saying “be the opposite of shitty” is not a lesson at all. It’s just Seth (or me) staring back at you like my English III teacher, full of expectation and no answers.\\nSo here’s what I learned by copying Seth: I like evocative examples, but I don’t like leaving the reader without a framework for finding a solution. I can’t explore an interesting thought in only 160 words. I like trying to leave the reader on an up-note. And I really did learn; see for example this article which exemplifies each of those specific lessons.\\nI copied others too, sometimes with attribution, like this satire piece about Joel Spolsky whose construction was 100% lifted off the first essay of Steve Almond’s Rants, Exploits, and Obsessions (not that you asked). Here I learned that it was really fun, but inventing structures like that is beyond my ability.\\nEven now I’m copying! Even now, after I seem to have “found my voice,” with 23,000 subscribers in apparent agreement, I’m still experimenting with other voices. Like this very post, which I’m doing in the style of James Altucher, except without the sexual exploits, and therefore far less entertaining.\\nSpecifically, like this post of James’s, I started with a personal story, but it won’t quite finish until the end where it wraps up with an almost trivial conclusion but leaves you with a sense of the larger point. I’m using shorter sentences than is my wont. I’m admitting embarrassing or disdainful\\xa0things about myself, like how I’m insecure and how I have to copy others’ style rather than being strong and perceptive enough to develop my own.\\nNow that you know this is an attempt at style duplication, you can see for yourself how much better James is at it than I. But “being as good as James at James’ style” is not the goal. The goal is to learn and grow as a writer, and this was fun to do.\\nThis technique is useful in almost any pursuit. I was the inter-mural racquetball champion at the University of Texas, and although it required lots of practice, I learned by watching the good players and trying to copy their movements—their swing, where they’d run, where they’d place the ball.\\nDid any great chef not, at various points in her career, intentionally learn various styles from various cultures?\\nEven Picasso—one of the most creative, innovating artists in history—first learned his craft by copying the styles of the Great Masters.\\nAs a culture, at least in America, we cherish creativity, we reward uniqueness. We’re obsessed with “innovation.” We’re trained that copying is evil.\\nRather, copying is one of the best ways of learning, growing, evaluating, and exploring. It’s a valid tool so long as we regard it as a means to an end.\\nCopying ironically helps you discover yourself: The way to discovering who you are, what you value, what you’re good at, what you believe, is to try things on, like clothes, to see what fits.\\xa0Bits and pieces of you are already reflected in the things around you, so pick up handfuls of other creations and see which bits you want to keep.\\nEventually the teacher’s pet found some commentary on Eudora Welty in our textbook, saying that Welty encapsulates Southern life and mores. We memorized it, in case it was on the test.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/learn-by-copy/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLearn by Copy\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

While “first” sounds impressive, in reality it doesn’t predict who will win.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We started the trend.”\\n“Wherever you hear companies talking about Managed WordPress Hosting, they are following our lead.”\\nThis is how one of our competitors attempts to differentiate and compete with us at WP Engine1. Is it effective?\\n\\n1\\n Editor’s note: This piece was written in 2011, when WP Engine was one and a half years old. As of this note in 2023, WP Engine is a Unicorn, while the competitor’s growth leveled off many years ago at less than 1/30th the size, then folded into a much larger company. With the benefit of hindsight, the point-of-view in this article was accurate.\\nMany startups insist they’re “first” at something. As they should—what’s the point of a new company that adds nothing new to the world? But is “first” a good thing? Does it make you better than your competition?\\nOn the surface being “first” sounds impressive, implying innovation and leadership. But upon reflection, it’s not.\\nGoogle wasn’t the first search engine, the iPod wasn’t the first MP3 player, DropBox wasn’t the first cloud filesystem, Excel wasn’t the first spreadsheet, Dell wasn’t the first PC manufacturer, Facebook wasn’t the first social network, and Cisco didn’t invent the router. Yet they are both the market leaders and their market’s greatest innovators.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeing first does imply innovation, but also implies the faults of “version one.” The first electric car, while innovative, was pretty bad by most standards—short-range, sluggish, unattractive, and constantly in the repair shop2.\\n\\n2\\n Tesla solved the first three of these four qualities, further demonstrating the point. Counter-point: Tesla was the first to create good-enough batteries, first to realize that “performance” was non-negotiable, and first to figure out how to leverage the different engineering constraints of EV to create the safest sedan ever made.\\nSo too with software—“v1.0” might imply novelty, but it also implies “buggy” and “incomplete.” Who wants their business to depend on a v1.0 product?\\nEven if you consider WP Engine to be nothing more than an imitator of this competitor (we’re not, but that’s a story for another time), the electric car analogy is apt, because in fact we’re an improvement in almost every way. We’re not the first electric car; instead we’re Tesla.\\nThis competitor had 40 minutes of downtime last month; we had 0 (according to Pingdom, an unaffiliated 3rd-party). We’re 30% faster at delivering HTML (also Pingdom). Our security service is better—we guarantee cleanup of any hacks while this competitor simply claims they’ve never been hacked (though we’ve found malware in customers of theirs who switched to us). Our support is more responsive and knowledgable because we employ more WordPress experts per 1000 customers than anyone.\\nThose are tangible competitive advantages; being “first” isn’t.\\nIn fact, being first can be a shackle because you’re stuck with supporting the legacy of that first version—features you thought were important but aren’t now (and maybe never were, a journey that new competitors will skip), grandfathered customers who are no longer profitable, architectural choices you wish you could change (and competitors started out avoiding), and a reputation that’s hard to revamp even if your company has in fact changed.\\nWorse, being first means you made all the mistakes in public. New competitors get to swoop in afterwards with the hindsight that you created—in pricing3, positioning, marketing, features, design, … everything. They get a running start without all your baggage. Thanks to you.\\n\\n3\\n Editor’s note: Years later, speaking to founders of a different competitor who didn’t yet exist at the time of original publishing, I asked how they determined their pricing. The answer: “We figured you’d already done the research and tested different things, so we just copied y’all.“\\nOf course there are situations where being first is indeed a massive advantage. This exception arises when you’re not only first, but also able to expand fast and continue innovate. Early MP3 players didn’t do this—they didn’t get huge traction and weren’t creative in hardware or design, which meant Apple had the space to innovate in design while the market was still largely up for grabs.\\nBut McDonalds and Ford were first and kept their leads, because they never stopped innovating in process and product, constantly driving down costs while adding new desirable features, using their lead to fund even stronger growth.\\nAmazon is the quintessential example of “first, but relentlessly innovative” in cloud infrastructure. They didn’t just put “cloud computing” on the map, they’ve never stopped lowering prices while expanding both depth and breadth of service. If they keep it up—and there’s currently no reason to think they won’t—it’s hard to see how anyone could overtake them. And so far no one has come close, though at least four multi-billion-dollar companies are trying4.\\n\\n4\\n Editor’s note: In 2023 this has not only held true, but more: They stopped lowering prices and still remain in the lead. Here is a case study with an explanation of the strategic moats that constructed this success.\\nSo yes it can work, and a well-funded startup combined with a stellar team and bit of good fortune can occasionally pull it off. But most little companies aren’t in that position, and it’s often not the best risk/reward anyway.\\nBeing “first” isn’t an end in itself—it’s not an advantage, not a feature, not a benefit the customer can experience. It can be a means to one of those ends—it can be levered into market dominance with persistence and the right strategy—or it can be a manacle that locks your company into a burden of legacy that allows newer competitors to pass you by.\\nYou should be proud of being “first” at something. But like being “disruptive,” being “first” isn’t necessarily desirable.\\nIt’s just history.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/first-competitive-advantage/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen being “first” is not a competitive advantage\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

So what? But neither is it wise to totally ignore the critics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI can rip any business idea to shreds.\\nTake Netflix1: The costs of inventory logistics, millions of non-technical customers, the Postal Service, and loss from wear and delivery will make profit impossible if you keep retail prices reasonable. Movie-watchers are accustomed to the immediate gratification of browsing and selecting. People will duplicate movies, pissing off the publishers. Blockbuster will duplicate the model and undercut the price, combining the convenience of home delivery with the equally convenient option of store browsing and returns.\\n\\n1\\n Editor’s Note: This was written in 2011, before Netflix pivoted to streaming.\\nTerrible idea that could never work. Except that now Blockbuster (who did copy it) is bankrupt and Netflix turned a profit of $60m last quarter, which is more than Blockbuster was doing at its peak.\\nI suppose if your goal in life is to be right, you should bet against every startup, certainly against any novel ideas. You’ll be right much more often than wrong.\\nRight, but useless. Right, but ensuring that nothing new or great will be created. We can even show mathematically why this is flawed, but you don’t need math to know that this isn’t a useful way to live.\\nThe goal of the entrepreneur is not to be “right.” At least, not right about everything, all the time, from the very start.\\nIt’s to construct with humility. To have strong opinions but seek better ones. To infect customers and employees with your peculiar disease. To live to fight another day. To acknowledge being wrong before the fault turns fatal.\\nTo realize that even if a particular venture is a “failure,” it never really is. I’ve never met a “failed” entrepreneur who doesn’t proudly declare they’re better off now: developed skills they never thought possible, learned what makes them excited to get up in the morning, came face-to-face with their fundamental limitations, and now more confident than ever in what they are capable of, regardless of the future shape of their career.\\nThe Lean Startup movement2 also values learning and experience over “being right,” specifically casting this concept as “running experiments.” And the great Francis Crick (Nobel-winner for discovery of DNA) posthumously agrees with that analogy:\\n\\n2\\n Editor’s Note: The Lean Startup book was published in the same year as this article.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dangerous man is the one who has only one idea, because then he’ll fight and die for it. The way real science goes is that you come up with lots of ideas, and most of them will be wrong.\\n—Francis Crick\\n\\n\\nReal science is mostly being wrong, but staying vigilant and honest enough to continue being wrong until you’re not wrong. So it is with dating. Or startups.\\nThe problem with armchair criticism is it’s so easy. Of course it’s easy.\\nDesigners want to be “right,” but have to temper that with analytics. The true masters are those who embrace metrics as an incontrovertible goal while also being creative enough to retain the aesthetics, creativity, and philosophy which makes their craft an art.\\nProgrammers want to be “right,” but have to temper that with getting things built and shipped, even before it’s ready, even with bugs, willing to build what customers actually want, and indeed features customers truly love instead of rationally calculated.\\nBackseat advisors and pundits (like me) want to be “right,” but have to temper that with the more important goal of inspiring people to be a better version of themselves instead of indoctrinating them with our own biases and experiences that contain unknown quantities of luck.\\nAs a founder, you still need to listen to critics with half an ear. Sometimes you have been blind, and they’re showing you the truth. I resist opposition to my ideas, more than I know I should. I still hate being wrong.\\nBut it has to be possible to be able negate you, otherwise you are certainly pig-headed. As the founder of WP Engine I feel that most days are filled with more contradictions than construction—balancing customer needs with internal costs, following our nose against what competitors are doing or saying versus staying true to our “vision” while also flexing as we learn what the market wants and even what we want for ourselves.\\nIt’s easy to criticize but it’s just as easy for you to dismiss criticism without consideration. That’s equally hazardous.\\nWhenever you get the criticism ask: Does it sting exactly because there’s an element of truth that I don’t want to face?\\nIgnore the messenger, ignore the emotion, and see whether it’s a gift of truth, poorly wrapped.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/criticize-create/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEasy to criticize, hard to create\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

But what if “being yourself” also means striving to become better? What is “yourself?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever your position on meat dresses, no one today is more vocal about being true to yourself than Lady Gaga:\\n\\nGod makes no mistakes.\\nI’m on the right track.\\nI was born this way.\\n\\nAs she’s said in interviews, she’s not speaking only to the LGBT community, she’s encouraging anyone who is seeking their identity, and looking for permission to be that person in public.\\nIt’s so simple and trite: Be yourself.\\nThe benefits are obvious: Fulfillment, happiness, success. Surely you’re more likely to be successful at any venture so long as your natural excitement leads to merry obsession, which leads to hard work and long hours, applied to a field aligned with your innate talents. Even in the worst case—complete failure—it was fun and worthwhile. Years from now you’ll look back and say, “I lived a good life, and it was my life.”\\nSo why is it so hard?\\nNot just hard to live true to yourself, but surprisingly difficult to even know what “yourself” is?\\nAnd further, what about self-improvement? It’s sensible to embrace your faults and work around them, but what about tackling them headlong? If you’re afraid of public speaking, is it smart to pick a career that ensures you’ll never grace a stage, or is it wiser to throw yourself into a stand-up comedy night-class that could exorcise your demon?\\nI used to think that in all things I had to be the best. I was upset if I didn’t get the blue ribbon in the piano recital, the gold medal on the music theory test, and the 1st-place trophy in the Karate tournament.\\nIn high school, however, I started internalizing that there will always be people smarter and better than me at anything, so the new challenge was to (1) be the best at one thing (telling a computer what to do), and (2) be constantly improving in other things. So I didn’t need to beat Alex Saltman on the Math Team, but I worked to beat my own scores in national competitions year over year. I didn’t have to outpace the endless stream of Korean piano prodigies but I did play progressively more difficult pieces, and played them well enough.\\nBut time wears on and responsibilities accumulate and you realize that even just “improving” can be too much work. Today I no longer need to improve my 5k time, I just make sure to run a few 5k’s a week. I don’t need to play harder piano pieces, I just learn something new now and again.\\nThat’s fine for hobbies, but what about your career or your startup? You can’t just say “Yeah I suck at selling stuff, and I don’t care!”\\nIn my case, I don’t suck at selling, but I constantly struggle with procrastination. Everyone does it to some degree—there’s something you don’t want to do, so you invent reasons to fulfill that desire. The reasons are all seemingly-logical but actually-bullshit:\\n\\nI don’t have time for X right now. (Time always exists, you’re deciding to do something else with that time.)\\nIt will be more efficient to do X when I’m also doing Y and Z. (But someone’s waiting for X, and you’ve also been delaying Y and Z.)\\nI’m not in the mood for X, and it will go twice as fast when I’m in the mood. (But it’s something you don’t like which means you’ll never be in the mood—or—you haven’t been in the mood for weeks.)\\nI forgot because I don’t have a good system. (But there’s 100 organization systems and tools, and blogs and books for training.)\\nI have better things to do with my time. (But then it should be delegated instead of sitting in your to-do list.)\\n\\nStill, knowing all this, I persist. It is on the to-do list and it is a “Next Action,” but I deftly roll the deadline over to “tomorrow” and it vanishes for another 24 hours. Congratulations, me, you just out-witted your to-do software.\\nBesides, procrastination has its advantages. Really! I wrote a whole post about why procrastination is useful for running a startup. See? SEE?!?\\nI’ve done everything to cope with procrastination: I’ve used GTD for years (and yes, it works). I’ve been inbox-zero for years (and yes, it literally changed my life). I’ve had temporary surges of success and guilt-ridden lapses of ineptitude. I’ve even tried to decide procrastination was a net-positive, hence that article.\\nSo where does that leave me with regard to Lady Gaga’s admonition that I should “be myself?” Should I accept procrastination as a given? Keep writing more articles about how I’m actually wise to embrace it? Or should I continue to fight it, because fighting means I’ll get more done in less time with less stress, and it means I’m optimizing for the long-run rather than what’s easiest in the moment?\\nI’ve decided to continue to the fight, because I know something else about “who I am”—I’m a person who strives. I’m a person for whom “good enough,” isn’t. I can tell myself it’s not important to run a 5k any faster than 26:06, but I’m going to anyway. I can lecture you about how blogging success is about content and time rather than looks and plugins, but I still wrote my own plugin to manage exactly how the “retweet” link behaves in the RSS feed.\\nThat attitude is something I see in most successful entrepreneurs. Adam Carolla says the same thing; he calls it a “motor”—an internal, unstoppable force causing you to just go, all the time, wake to sleep, for decades.\\nIt’s why I couldn’t just make software facilitating peer code review, I had to make it a so-called “real company,” I had to create the modern theory around it, I had to write a book about it, and I had to push that book into 70,000 people’s hands.\\nIt’s why I couldn’t just read blog posts by Joel Spolsky and Jason Fried, I had to write my own, and I had to get better and better at writing, and promote myself, for no reason or reward other than pure ego.\\nIt’s why I couldn’t just be retired after the sale of Smart Bear, writing blog posts and talking to entrepreneurs. New ideas foisted themselves on me, and I had to run through bad ones until I found a good one, and I had to go start that company. It’s why so many entrepreneurs are serial entrepreneurs—I like to say “You do the third one for the same reason you did the first one—because you are compelled to.”\\nIt’s why I couldn’t just be interviewed twice on Andrew Warner’s Mixergy—already an honor. I had to push for a third appearance so I could interview Andrew on his own show.\\nBut the motor also creates problems common to most entrepreneurs, no matter how old or successful:\\n\\n“Spread too thin” syndrome. You’re interested in everything, you’re good at many things, so you get involved in too much stuff. Now you don’t have enough time for any of them; most suffer as a result, probably even worse off than if you weren’t involved, because then other people could plan accordingly instead of believing they can rely on you.\\n“Shiny new thing” syndrome. You’re bored as soon as a project leaves the childhood of “mostly creative” and enters the adolescence of “mostly execution.” So you don’t give projects the lasting attention they need to succeed.\\n“Work all the time” syndrome. This works better when you’re young, but even then you’ll burn out. I did, and many many other famous workaholics did, repeatedly, thought they rarely admit it. Andrew Warner is honest enough to admit publicly that he sold his company for less than he should have just because of burn-out. Pulling 70-hour weeks catches up to you. Period.\\n“Not good enough” syndrome. Whether you’re actually a perfectionist or just a control-freak, you feel like nothing is ever finished, ever done, ever enough. And when you implicitly believe others will discover your ineptitude, or that others are able to be perfect where you’re not, you (like me) have real problems.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, these things are all manageable by acknowledging them and acting accordingly. Learn to say “no” to new projects (allowing you to continue a healthy obsession over a few). Go on a trip without the laptop so you have no choice but to be “unproductive.” (Do that once for a week and you’ll be so amazed at your increased productivity, energy, and happiness when you return that you’ll never doubt this tool again. Take it from this workaholic.)\\nSo “be yourself,” yes. Don’t vomit out some stupid marketing prose on your website; decide what you believe, then run your company accordingly and publicly and you will be more proud, more fulfilled, and likely more successful. You can’t fight every foible, nor should you. You certainly shouldn’t compromise your ethics and your sense of taste and awesomeness, because those are some of the few things that can differentiate you and your company in the world.\\nBut neither should you stop striving, improving, learning, and developing “who you are.”\\nYou are your motor.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/be-yourself/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBeing who you are, while becoming better\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

How color vision actually works\\n\\nby Jason Cohen on January 31, 2011\\n\\n\\n\\nArtists say all colors are a mixture of red, yellow, and blue. But physics and TV screens and printers disagree. How does color really work?\\n\\nWhy are artists special? \\nAsk any artist to explain how color works, and they’ll launch into a treatise about how the Three Primary Colors—red, blue, and yellow—form a color wheel:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy “wheel?” All other colors are created by mixing these three colors various proportions, they’ll explain. In particular, mixing equal quantities of each pair of Primary Colors produces the Secondary Colors (orange, green, and purple):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuing this process produces the full color wheel you might have learned in school; a pretty, symmetrical, satisfying device in which each hue melds seamlessly and linearly into the next:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, this crumbles under even minor scrutiny \\nFor example, open up your desktop printer and you’ll see something quite different:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThree colors of ink which, when combined, produce all others: cyan, magenta, and yellow. (Black is included as a money-saver—black is the cheapest and most common color; it’s cheaper to have a black cartridge than to dump ink from the other three.)\\nBut wait! I thought the “Primary” colors were red, blue, and yellow, not cyan (bluish-green), magenta (bluish-red), and yellow. So on primary is the same (yellow) but the other two are different… yet these still generate color wheels containing all the other colors. So what does the “Primary” designation really mean?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso it’s not as simple as saying “any three colors can produce all the others” because that’s clearly not true (by experiment). And it’s not as simple as saying “any three colors will do, they just have to be equally spaced around the color wheel,” because yellow is common to both the painter’s and printer’s wheel, yet the other two primaries differ completely (red and blue are primary in the painter’s wheel but secondary in the printer’s wheel.)\\nTVs and computers are different yet again. If you stand close to a CRT (non-flat-screen), you can see that every pixel (or “dot”) is really three tightly-packed colored phosphors: red, green, and blue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’ve done computer graphics you’ve been forced to name colors using these “RGB color values;” true geeks automatically think “yellow” when they see #FFFF00. (If it’s intuitive to you that #A33F17 is burnt orange, it’s time for you to leave the monastery.)\\nThis leads to yet another system of three “Primary” colors generating all the others, and yet another color wheel. This one is a little easier to explain—ink and paint are “subtractive” (adding cyan, magenta, and yellow yields black) whereas colored light is “additive” (adding red, green, and blue yields white):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, we have yet another color wheel in which two (but not all three!) “primaries” match those of the artist’s wheel and none match the printer’s wheel.\\nThis isn’t adding up. Let’s turn to science.\\nPhysics makes it worse \\nPhysics is clear and certain. Light is a wave of electromagnetic energy (and/or a particle, but for today it’s just a wave OK?) and, like a vibrating guitar string, light waves wiggle at certain frequencies. Some of those frequencies we detect with our eyes, and the frequency determines its color:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we’re getting somewhere! Or are we?\\nFirst off, we’ve suddenly lost the notion of a “wheel.” As much as the previous color systems have contradicted each other, at least they all agreed that hues transform smoothly and continuously, one to the next, a beautiful symmetry with neither beginning nor end.\\nBut here we have a clear beginning (red) and end (violet). The colors in-between are continuous—and seem to generally match the order seen in the various color wheels—but then it just terminates with violet. How does it get back to red? What about that fuchsia / magenta / purplish-reddish color which is clearly present in every color wheel but missing from the physical spectrum?\\nHow can a color be missing? Where does it come from?\\nBut wait, we’re not done being confused.\\nAnd another thing: Opposites \\nEvery seven-year-old kid in America is taught that “the opposite of red is green” and “the opposite of blue is yellow.” But what does that mean exactly?\\nAfter all, there’s nothing in that linear physical light spectrum to indicate that any color is “the opposite” of any other, particularly not those two pairs. And the color wheels aren’t much help either; trying to match the “opposites” on the painter’s wheel yields an unsatisfying asymmetry where two of the primaries are opposite, and the third is opposite from a secondary:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut “opposites” are real. In the early 1800s Goethe (yes, the Goethe) noticed that red/green and blue/yellow were never perceived together, in the sense that no color could be described as a combination of those pairs. No color could be described as “reddish green.” If you are asked to imagine “a green with a bit of red,” nothing comes to mind. In the following 150 years, various experiments tested this idea, all of which validated his observation.\\nThere’s something to this. Something neither the wheels nor the spectrum can explain.\\nIt’s time to get down to the real source of color: The ridiculous complexity of human beings.\\nThe answer: Physiology (of course) \\nCaveat Emptor: The following is a gross and irresponsible over-simplification of what actually happens. But it’s correct in its general thrust, and few people on Earth (myself excluded) are qualified to explain with complete accuracy, so in the interest of general illumination, no pun intended, OK maybe intended just a little bit, I’m doing it anyway.\\nOf course it starts in the eye, where three types of cells called “cones” measure the amount of red, green, and blue light hitting the retina.\\n“Ah ha,” I can hear you CSS freaks scream, “it’s RGB after all! I was right! All that time spent—nay invested—in remembering that #001067 is the default title-bar color in Windows 95 was well worth it!”\\nHold on there, cowboy. Actually “amount of red, green, and blue” is a gross simplification (as warned!). Peaking under the hood (just a tad), the three types of cones are in fact denoted S, M, and L for “short, medium, and long” wavelengths, and each respond at different levels in a range of wavelengths:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I digress, and besides I did promise to be all gross and irresponsible, so let’s go back to that.\\nSo there are R, G, and B cones. The signals from these cones don’t go straight to the brain; they first pass through a pre-processing filter, and it’s this filter that explains all the mysteries. Actually there are three filters.\\nFilter #1 works like this:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplanation: The more R there is, the more positive the signal; the more G, the more negative the signal. If there’s relatively equal amounts of R and G—whether from none of both, a little of both, or a lot of both—the signal is zero.\\nThis explains why there’s no “greenish-red.” Because:\\nLet’s say R and G can go between 0 and 100 units of intensity. Consider the case of “full red with a little green,” where R=100 (full intensity) and G=25 (one-quarter intensity). Then separately consider the case of “strong red with no green,” where R=75 and G=0.\\nIn both cases, Filter #1 computes the same output signal: 75. But remember the brain doesn’t get the raw R and G signals—it only gets the filter’s output—so the brain cannot tell the difference between these two scenarios.\\nSo there’s no such thing as “red with a little green”—there’s just a less intense red. The brain physically cannot see “greenish-red” because the filter removes that polarity.\\nKnowing that blue/yellow is the other opposite pair, you can probably guess what Filter #2 is:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere blue (B) is opposed with a combination of both the R and G channels. The R and G cones are stimulated either when there’s literally both red and green light (like when a CSS coder turns on both red and green as to create yellow), or when 570nm light (yellow, on the visible spectrum) stimulates both R and G cones.\\nFilter #3 is simple:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn short, it measures the quantity of light without regard to hue. This is “how bright,” or “luminance” in color-theory parlance.\\nAnd magenta? It comes from full R and B with no G, activating Filter #1 full-positive, Filter #2 at zero. It’s not a physical wavelength of color, it’s just a combination of outputs of two filters.\\nA corrected color wheel \\nTo do this “wheel” thing properly, you should represent the red/green and blue/yellow opposites. It’s not at all difficult, so it amazes me how rarely it’s seen or taught:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFour primary colors? Yes, why not? It’s the closest thing to the physiology without getting complex.\\nBonus Brain Bender: The context / color connection \\nThis is just the beginning of color theory. To give you a glimpse at how complex it gets, consider this:\\nWhen a color is juxtaposed to other colors, we perceive it as a different color. For example, most people will say the small square on the left is brown, whereas the one on the right is orange:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\nJosef Albers, Folder IV-1\\n\\n\\nActually, the squares are exactly the same color! The surrounding context dictates the perceived color, on top of all that wavelength-physiology we just did.\\nThis makes sense because the brain projects abstract things it knows about the natural world onto your perception of color. For example, we know intuitively that shadows artificially darken colors, so our brains automatically account for this in our perception of those colors. (It’s called “color constancy.”) For example, you know that the dark and light colors on this hot air balloon are “the same:”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it also results in optical illusions so powerful that even when you know the trick you still can’t see it correctly.\\nLike this: Which square is darker: A or B?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact A and B are the same color (#787878), but you can’t see it even when you know this. To prove it to myself I had to open this picture in an image editor and actually move one square over another to see it was the same.\\nFreaky.\\nFurther Reading \\nYou got this far? You still care? Sheesh, you’re as weird as me.\\nIf you really want to lose a few days of your life, this is an amazing, in-depth treatise on color theory. That link is just page 1 of 8.

Not the advantage you thought it was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most common reaction to my recent announcement1 of starting a new WordPress hosting company was that this blog provides me with a ridiculous unfair advantage.\\n\\n1\\n Editor’s Note: This was written in 2010.\\nBut did it?\\nHere’s what people said:\\n\\n“[You’re starting from nothing] except approximately 18,000 prospects. How convenient. ;) I wish I had that kind of mailing list starting out.”\\n“You’re doing this the easy way, publishing this post so that thousands of users see it.”\\n“It is, of course, simple to talk about how easy it is to be popular, when you’re the already established prom queen.”\\n\\nFair point, but what actually happened after that post announcement? How unfair was this advantage?\\nInterestingly, Eric Sink got the same reception years ago when he launched a little company of his own. It’s worth hearing Eric defend himself because it’s just like my scenario, but because this happened six years ago I can reveal his results at the end of this post:\\n\\n“Reactions to my Winnable Solitaire experiment were mostly positive, but several people claimed my experiment was “unfair” or “invalid”. In a nutshell, they argued that because I am already “famous” for my writings about the business of software, I have an advantage that is not available to my readers. My experiment is therefore meaningless because I did not duplicate the conditions a regular person would be facing when trying to launch their own micro-ISV.”\\n\\nLet’s start with the results of my announcement:\\nWPEngine got two new signups. Only two. That with 18,000 wonderful, loyal, friendly, supportive RSS subscribers and as many page-hits from Twitter and HackerNews.\\nNot exactly the massive boost you nor I was expecting. I figured on 10-20 new customers at minimum and dreamed of 50. I was wrong by an order of magnitude2.\\n\\n2\\n Another example of why you cannot predict the future.\\nEric had a similar result: One month into his Winnable Solitaire experiment he had sold a total of six copies. Hooray for fame.\\nOthers too:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n(Here is her excellent article answering why.)\\n\\n\\nLet’s put this into broader context: At WPEngine we had 50 paying customers (not prospects) before my post went live. Most are paying $49/mo, a few pay north of $1000/mo (large blogs with serious traffic). So whatever we did without the advantage of this blog was far more important, at least for getting initial customers. (I’ll explain exactly how we did that in future posts3.)\\n\\n3\\n Editor’s note: It took 13 years, but I finally wrote up that process for customer discovery, as well as a complete roadmap for Product / Market Fit.\\nStill, the blog was instrumental in getting those first 50 customers, but not because I’m able to push WordPress hosting onto 18,000 unsuspecting victims, a.k.a. 1000 “true fans.” The blog did help with building the team.\\nIt’s no secret that the team is a critical factor in a startup’s success; have you ever heard otherwise? But there’s precious little advice about finding and gathering that stellar team. Interviews on the subject invariably turn up explanations like “we went to school together” or “we worked together” or “we met at StartupWeekend \" In short, you put yourself in an environment where you’re likely to interact with other intelligent, capable people, and hope that you find someone socially compatible who is also crazy enough to want to do a startup. It’s a good strategy, and anyway what else can you do?\\nI knew I needed a killer team for WPEngine—not just “capable,” but a group that would itself be an unfair advantage. See, “WordPress Hosting” is already a commodity, with every hosting company on Earth offering something at every price point from $0/mo, $5/mo, $15/mo, $40/mo, and even $500/mo + $200/hr consulting fees. In a mature market you need severe points of differentiation or moats, and one of those (I felt) had to be the team itself.\\nWe needed someone like Aaron Brazell. Aaron is a WordPress core contributor and the author of WordPress Bible (Wiley). He’s famous enough that strangers at WordPress conventions ask for autographs of their dog-eared copy of his infamous tome. He has seventeen zillion Twitter and blog followers, most of whom are themselves active in the WordPress community. He knows all the major players in the industry including the key folks at WordPress.com, BZ Media (the CopyBlogger media group), ProBlogger, and members of the press at Mashable, TechCrunch, and others.\\nMaybe with an Aaron we’d have a chance. His network should provide an ocean of free leads. His reputation transferred to the company would bless us with instant credibility. His press connections should give us pops of traffic and external legitimacy. His intimate knowledge of WordPress internals and roadmap should mean our service is technically superior. That’s a lot of advantages! Maybe enough to make or break a little new upstart.\\nWell we got Aaron, and it’s because of this blog. When I called Aaron he was charging an obscene (and well-deserved) hourly rate for WordPress consulting in Washington DC, but he was yearning for the startup life. He was ready for the trade-off of definitely less money now in exchange for possibly more money later, and for building something of lasting value instead of the impermanent drudgery of un-screwing hacked WordPress installations.\\nAnd the blog sealed the deal. Aaron could have joined (or started-up) any number of startups, but he liked WPEngine because he wanted to do a startup with me. And he wanted to do a startup with me because the blog revealed my attitude, perspective, and credentials.\\nAaron picked up, moved to Austin, and has already been instrumental to our success thus far.\\nSo fame does help in important ways—enough even to deserve the title of “unfair advantage\"—but startups are still hard and unlikely to succeed no matter who’s at the helm. Case in point? Eric Sink.\\nEric’s experiment eventually failed. Well, “fail” is a too harsh a word, it’s just the one in-vogue nowadays, especially when describing an wonderful experience in which you had fun, learned a lot, grew as a person, and wouldn’t trade it for anything, particularly not a dull, predictable day job. You know, the kind of “fail” that characterizes a lot of software startups.\\nOn sales of $216, Eric sold Winnable Solitaire for a small sum. Of course neither the exit nor the to-date revenue amounts to anything that anyone would declare a success.\\nWPEngine’s revenue to date is several orders of magnitude more, so hopefully we’ll avoid that fate4.

Here’s how to fix that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich of these sets of dots were placed randomly?\\nWe think “right,” but the answer is “left.” Humans are bad at seeing the difference between patterns and randomness.\\n(From Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature 2011)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do these have in common?\\n\\n“This pitcher has retired 5 of the last 7 batters.”\\n“We tried 10 AdWords variants and combination D is the clear winner.”\\n“The Bible Code predicted the Sept 11 attacks 5,000 years ago.”\\n“We sliced our Google Analytics data every which way, and these 4 patterns emerged.”\\n\\nAll are examples of a common fallacy that I’m dubbing the “Pattern-Seeker.”\\nYou probably laugh at Nostradamus, yet it’s likely you’re committing the same error with your own data.\\nPatterns in Chaos \\nIt’s commonly said that basketball players are “streaky”—they get on a roll hitting 3-pointers (have a “hot hand”) or develop a funk where they can’t seem to land a shot (“gone cold”). These observations are made by fans, announcers, pundits, and the players themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1985 Thomas Gilovich tested whether players really did exhibit streaky behavior. It’s simple—just record hits and misses in strings like: HMHHMMMMHMMHH, then use standard statistical tests to measure whether those strings are typical of a random process, or whether there is something more systematic going on.\\nTurns out players are not streaky; simply flipping a coin produces the same sort of runs of H’s and M’s. The scientists gleefully explained this result to basketball pundits; the pundits remained unimpressed and unconvinced. (Surprised?)\\nSo they tried the same experiment backward: They created their own strings of H’s and M’s with varying degrees of true streakiness and showed those to pundits and fans, asking them to classify which were streaky and which were random. Again they failed completely, much like the “star field” test at the top of the article.\\nWe perceive patterns in randomness, and it extends beyond casual situations like basketball punditry, plaguing us even when we’re trying to be intentionally, objectively analytical.\\nTake the “interesting statistic” given by the baseball announcers in the first example above. Sure the last 5 of 7 batters were retired, but the act of picking the number 7 implies that number 8 got on base, and so did the one before the sample window. So it’s at least “5 of 9,” not “5 of 7,” but that doesn’t sound as impressive, even though it’s the same data.\\nUnlike the basketball example, the baseball announcer’s error runs deeper, and following that thread will bring us to our own marketing data and the heart of the fallacy.\\nSeeking combinations \\nBaseball statisticians record a dizzying smorgasbord of statistics that announcers eagerly regurgitate. Maybe it’s because baseballers are a little OCD (evidenced by pre-bat and pre-pitch rituals) or maybe it’s because they need something to say to soak up the time between pitches, but in any case the result is a mountain of data.\\nAnnouncers exploit that data for the most esoteric of observations:\\n\\n“You know, Rodriguez is 7 for 8 against left-handed pitchers in asymmetric ballparks when the tide is going out during El Niño.”\\n\\nThis is the epitome of Pattern-Seeking—combing through a mountain of data until you find a pattern.\\nSome statistician examined millions of combinations of player data and external factors until he happened across a combination which included a “7 of the last 8,” which sure sounds impressive and relevant. Then he proudly delivered the result as if it were insight.\\nSo what’s wrong with stumbling across curious observations? Isn’t that how you make unexpected discoveries?\\nNo, it’s how to convince yourself you’ve made a discovery when in fact you’re looking at pure randomness. Let’s see why.\\nEven a fair coin appears unfair if you’re Pattern-Seeking \\nThe fallacy is clearer when you look at an extreme yet accurate analogy.\\nI’m running an experiment to test whether a certain coin is biased. During one “trial” I’ll flip the coin 10 times and count how often it comes up heads. 5 heads out of 10 would suggest a fair coin; so would 6 or even 7, due to typical random variation.\\nWhat if I get 10 heads in a row? Well a fair coin could exhibit that behavior, but it would be rare—a 1 in 1024 event. So if my experiment consists of just one trial and I get 10 heads, the coin is suspicious.\\nBut suppose I did a “10-flip trial” one thousand times. A fair coin should still come up heads 3-7 times in each trial, but every once in a while it will come up 9 or 10 times. Those events are rare, but I’m flipping so much that rare events will naturally occur. In fact, in 1000 trials there’s a 62% chance that I’ll see 10 heads at least once.\\nThis is the crux of the fallacy. When an experiment produces a result that is highly unlikely to have happened by chance, you conclude that something systematic is at work. But when you’re “seeking interesting results” instead of performing an experiment, highly unlikely events will necessarily happen, yet still you conclude something systematic is at work.\\nIndeed, this is one reason why scaling a business is so hard: Scale makes rare things common.\\nBringing it home to marketing and sales data \\nLet’s apply the general lesson of the coin-flipping experiment to Google Analytics. There’s a hundred ways to slice and dice data, so that’s what you do. If you compare enough variables enough ways, you’ll find some correlations:\\n\\n“Oh look, when we use landing page variation C along with AdWord text F, our conversion rate is really high on Monday mornings.”\\n\\nExcept you sound just like the baseball announcer, tumbling combinations of factors until something “significant” falls out.\\nExcept you’re running 1000 coin-flip trials, looking only at the trial where it came up all heads and declaring the coin “biased.”\\nExcept you’re seeing streaks, hoping that this extra-high conversion rate is evidence of a systematic, controllable force.\\nThe solution: Form a theory, test the theory \\nYou can use apparent patterns to form a theory; that’s good.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most exciting phrase in science isn’t “eureka,” but rather, “that’s funny.\\n—Isaac Asimov\\n\\n\\nBut then you have to test it, so that it’s science, not baseball announcing.\\nSo:\\n\\nInstead of using a thesaurus to generate 10 ad variants, decide what pain-points or language you think will grab potential customers and test that theory specifically.\\nInstead of rooting around Google Analytics hoping to find a combination of factors with a good conversion rate, decide beforehand which conversion rates are important for which cohorts, then measure and track those only.\\nInstead of asking customers leading questions or collecting scattered thoughts, form hypotheses and intentionally test them.\\nInstead of blindly following the startup founder who dramatically succeeded (the 1-in-1000 coin flip?), gather advice and observations that align with your style and goals.\\n\\nAnd then never stop testing your theories, because you never know when the environment changes, or you change, or you find something even better.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you’ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you’ve made a discovery.\\n—Enrico Fermi\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/pattern-seeking-fallacy/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe Pattern-Seeking Fallacy\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Patterns in ChaosSeeking combinationsEven a fair coin appears unfair if you’re Pattern-SeekingBringing it home to marketing and sales dataThe solution: Form a theory, test the theory\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

This exercise will make your positioning and strategy stronger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your company were allowed only one advantage over the competition, what would a sales call look like, starting with your 30-second pitch, then dealing with skeptical questions, earning this potential customer’s interest, respect, and eventually money, all with only one advantage?\\nImpossible? Pointless? Neither!\\nYou should go through this exercise because this skill is valuable in every sales call. Sometimes you’re defending the few advantages you have over a specific competitor. Sometimes you’re arguing the virtues of small businesses over large ones. Sometimes you’re defending your product against what the potential customer perceives as a glaring lack of functionality.\\nHanging your hat on just one advantage that you can own completely is stronger than diluting your message by making many assertions.\\nIt’s not just in face-to-face sales calls either.\\xa0Your homepage becomes laser-focused. Your advertisements become pointed, powerful, pithy, and other words starting with “p.” Your 30-second pitch becomes compelling. You know what to blog and Twitter about. Your 5-minute product demo reinforces a singular point. Everyone knows who you are and where you stand. Especially Carol: Your extra-special ICP (Ideal Customer Profile).\\nAt least on this one point, you’re untouchable. Doesn’t that sound nice? It is nice.\\nBut don’t you need lots of advantages to overcome sales objections and competition? No. Let’s see how to riff off single advantages, using them to answer a range of skeptical questions and concerns.\\nIf nothing else, this should get your juices flowing and make future sales calls and marketing messages more effective.\\nMost Expensive \\nYou: We’re the Cadillac tool—the most expensive, but also the best. I know, “most expensive” doesn’t automatically imply “best!” But in our case you get what you pay for.\\nCustomer: Hmm, I don’t know, budgets are tight. We’re thinking of going open-source—it’s free.\\nYou: Open-source is free like puppies are free. You don’t write a check to get it, but you have to support it for life. Your employee’s time is not free. Working around bugs is not free. Having nothing but the Web of Lies Internet to rely on for tech support is not free. See, we don’t line our pockets with that revenue, we spend it making you maximally effective. We answer the phone on the first ring. When you have a problem, we connect you directly with developers instead of hiding behind off-shore Level 1 support. We’ll stay on the line with you at 3am as you work through a problem. We’ll do a conference call helping you through best-practices on using the tool for your specific purpose. We do things an open-source project cannot do.\\nCustomer: OK, that’s useful. But BigCorp offers 24/7 tech support too and they have consultants.\\nYou: It’s quality, not quantity. Let’s get specific. We employ actual software developers for Level 1 tech support and email, so you’re talking to someone who not only can answer every question but can even read the code to get answers. You’re talking to someone who has the power and ability to change the code to fix a bug or add a feature. That’s an inside track that no big company will offer. And consultants? Our consultants write blog posts about best practices. Our consultants live with the entire team every day. Our consultants train with the top experts in the field, who we can afford because we’re the Cadillac. You’re not getting someone who realized they can turn a buck installing high-priced software—you’re getting true experts giving you insight that only we can provide.\\nCustomer: I’m also checking out SimpleCo’s tool. They’re much cheaper, and although they don’t have as many features, it seems simpler to use.\\nYou: Just because they do less doesn’t mean they’re easier to use. For example, one of the reasons we’re expensive is that we integrate with 20 other software packages. That’s great for you, because it means we interoperate with more of your other tools—including that tool you’re going to buy next year but you don’t know it yet. But it’s not more complex for you, because if you don’t use an integration, that has zero impact on your day-to-day use. There’s a myth that “more features are always more complex,” but that’s just bad user interface design. And yes, you guessed it, we can afford awesome user interface experts who help us avoid those mistakes.\\nCustomer: But still, even if I agree with all that, I still have to justify the budget today.\\nYou: When you factor in the cost of the tool, also factor in the cost of failing to be successful with the tool. To spend many months installing, integrating, training, learning, customizing, fighting, on the line with tech support, only to have it fail in the end—having to rip it out, then go through the whole process again with a new tool. Multiply that by the chance the tool will indeed fail. Sure it’s possible that any tool could fail, but with us—more features, better support, expert help—it’s less likely to happen. Oh, and besides the catastrophic expense, what’s the effect on your personal career? What’s best for you and your company is to bet on the best.\\n(Will this work? I don’t know, but at least the talk-track is clear.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\nObsessed with Quality \\nYou: Software is so crappy nowadays, we expect failure. We expect bugs. We expect to be helpless, to just have to “deal with it.” At AwesomeCorp, we say that’s unacceptable.\\nCustomer: Yeah…. so you’re saying you have no bugs at all?\\nYou: No, I’m saying we’re maniacal about finding bugs, and when you find one we’re incredibly fast at fixing them. It’s not unusual to have a fix in under 24 hours. All software can have bugs, but no one is more committed to fixing them.\\nCustomer: Well if that’s true, that’s good. But I’m currently trialing BigCorp’s tool and they have more features than you. I don’t know which we’ll need, but I have a problem buying a tool that doesn’t do much.\\nYou: It sometimes sounds like “more bullet points of more features” is always better, but you and I have used software that claimed to have lots of useful features that didn’t really work in reality. Usually the more features a product has, the worse each feature is. Try uploading a huge file to BigCorp’s tool—oops, it breaks! To us, saying you have a feature when in reality it’s full of holes is dishonest. We’d rather know we have fewer features that we actually stand behind rather than claim to have features that are just incomplete.\\nCustomer: OK, I can appreciate that, but what about OpenSourceOrg’s tool? I know it doesn’t do quite as much as yours, but free is free!\\nYou: Yup, free is free… until you run into a bug. It’s free until it has a security breach that you didn’t find out about for two years. It’s free until you notice there’s incorrect data floating around. It’s free until you need something and there’s no one to ask. Of course they say “you can fix that bug yourself” or “you can add that feature yourself,” but that ain’t free! And even if you invest the effort, if they don’t accept your patch you’ll constantly have to re-patch when you get updates. Bugs are a reality, and that’s when open-source starts to become non-free in a hurry. We, on the other hand, never charge you for bug fixes, even years later, because we’re 100% committed to quality code.\\n(Will this work? I don’t know, but at least the talk-track is clear.)\\nSmall Company \\nYou: If you haven’t worked with a small company before, you’re in for a nice surprise: Smart people you can actually talk to, people who care about what you need, people willing to go out of their way to make sure you’re successful.\\nCustomer: I get that, but little companies fail all the time. How do I know you’ll be around to give me that great support?\\nYou: You say that as if big companies are stable during recessions and accounting scandals! You say that as if big companies don’t cut entire product lines if they’re not profitable, or sell them off even if they are. It’s impossible to know when a big company is about to discontinue your product, and it happens all the time.\\nCustomer: You say you have great support, but BigCorp is the one with 1000 developers and support engineers willing to help me.\\nYou: “Willing” to help you perhaps, but able? Typically the software developers are shielded by “Level 1 support”—people without power, certainly not the power to get your feature requests into the pool. In fact, wouldn’t you agree most tech support feels like a shield rather than a help? Even if you get a bug into the pile or a feature onto the list, big companies release new versions infrequently, so you might have to live without it for a year. Not us. You get to complain directly to the engineers who can fix the problem in weeks—sometimes days.\\nCustomer: But they have 24/7 support. Do you have that?\\nYou: No, we don’t pay folks we’ve never met $1.25/hour to answer the phone at 3am PST so they can tell you to reboot your machine and RTFM. Instead we pay actual software developers $75/hour to talk with you in person about exactly what’s wrong, either solving the problem or getting it fixed ASAP. Sometimes we even write special code just to get you running again, tiding you over until a proper fix is released. Try getting that from BigCorp!\\nCustomer: Well if that’s true, that’s good. But BigCorp also has more features than you.\\nYou: Do you really want your tools to have “more features,” or is it really that you want your specific needs met, and “more features” could potentially mean that more of your needs are met? We believe the point of software is to solve your problems and make your life better without incurring too much new expense in time and money. Even assuming BigCorp’s has one or two features you like today, what about in six months when you’re deep into the tool and realize there’s 10 more things you really want? Do you expect them to add half of those to their next release? Because that’s exactly what we’re going to do—hold proactive meetings to find out what you need to be most productive, and agree to add those as soon as we can. Don’t ask “Which tool will satisfy my needs today,” ask “One year from now, which tool will be satisfying my needs, including the ones I can’t foresee?”\\n(Will this work? I don’t know, but at least the talk-track is clear.)\\n\\nWhy try to defend ten points when you only need one or two to make your case?\\nWhy not focus your message, focus your behavior, focus your UX, focus your product, focus your target customer, and focus your sales pitch?\\nIt’s already hard enough to stake out a niche in this massive world! Don’t dilute your message.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/one-benefit/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPick one and own it\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\nInside this article\\n\\n(\\u2006Top\\u2006)Most ExpensiveObsessed with QualitySmall Company\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

I was focused.”\\nPenelope Trunk (yes, she has insights on both sides of this issue) on how all-consuming her company is: “I’m desperate. … You’re always sick, but not take-a-day-off-work sick. … So I suffer with the pink eye, because it’s not having all that gross green discharge yet, so I think I can deal with it after funding. … I diagnose my [temporary] blindness as stress related. … I say, ‘My eyes are nothing compared to the pain of raising money.’ … There’s no time for family.\\n\\n“So what,” you could argue, “just because many successful entrepreneurs are workaholics doesn’t mean that’s the only path to success.”\\nIndeed, study after study has shown that “working more hours” doesn’t translate into “accomplishing more shit.” If you’re not getting enough sleep, for instance, working extra hours doesn’t make up for your foggy brain.\\nAlso, optimizing how you spend your time can increase productivity several times over—an increase you couldn’t possibly match by working more hours.\\nYeah, but here’s the problem.\\nThe “Rule of Closets” is that the amount of crap you own will expand to fill all available closet space. You can create more space by adding shelves and organizers, but then you’ll soon discover you have more stuff.\\nWell I have a “Rule of Time in Startups”: How much time does a bootstrapped company take? All of it.\\nEven ten people could hardly keep up with everything you do in small business—creating, consulting, designing, fixing, self-promotion, blogging, networking, bookkeeping, taxes, customer support and cultivation, reading startup blogs for ideas and inspiration (!), and all those little crappy things like losing an afternoon troubleshooting your fancy outsourced IP phone system that was supposed to let you “work from anywhere.”\\nOne, two, or even three people can’t do everything, so of course it takes all your time. If you’re working a day job while starting something on the side, of course you don’t have time to exercise or play with your kids before bed.\\nIt takes obsession to make a little company go. Forget “passion”—everyone’s favorite word—it’s “obsession.” It’s not just that you love working, it’s that you can’t stop working. You’re putting your entire self on the line—your finances, your career, your ideas.\\nThe obsession is there even when you’re away from the office, having lunch with a friend or reading to your kids. As my wife would frequently point out in the early years of Smart Bear, my “mental and emotional bandwidth” was entirely consumed. You’re physically there, but you’re not really there.\\nRead those quotes above again and you’ll see not just passion but self-destructive devotion.\\xa0You don’t put yourself through this meat grinder just because you “like something a lot.”\\n“If you love it so much, why don’t you marry it?”\\nExactly.\\nOf course those life-coaches are still correct: This isn’t a great way to live your entire life. You need to accept that this is going to happen and ask whether it’s OK to incur this penalty right now. For me, I did all this in my 20’s when I had no kids, I had enough savings to risk everything for a while, and I had a wife who had her own business and who therefore understood how much work it took and why I was spacing out over dinner.\\nBottom line: Every successful bootstrapper I know puts work before self. (Until financial freedom is achieved.) I did too.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/sacrifice-your-health-for-your-startup/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSacrifice your health for your startup\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

You fill in a template consisting of a cute story tenuously connected to a dramatic point, inspiring wanna-bes to commiserate and laugh with indignation at the stupidity of others.\\nWhile they’ve been laughing, I’ve wondering whether you practice what you preach. You admonish programmers who don’t understand Unicode, yet five years later our copy of Fogbugz still cannot receive email from Korea because of a character encoding issue.\\nAlso, are you out of gas? Your column in Inc Magazine consists of 1300-word reproductions of chapters from your book which themselves are reproductions of blog entries you wrote in 2001. And your blog has turned into announcements for products and trade shows.\\nI can already hear your fanboys calling for my head, but from where I’m sitting, you’re a celebrity who is cashing in on fame, no longer compelled to have new ideas.\\nBut introspection isn’t your thing. Admitting you’ve been wrong or that you don’t take your own advice would crack your well-crafted façade.\\nI’m not like that, and I can’t pretend otherwise for you or your readers. I’m afraid the answer is no.\\nSincerely,  Jason\\n\\nDear Mr. Spolsky,\\nI’m not sure if you received the last email I sent. I hope not. I used Outlook’s “recall this message” feature, but sometimes that doesn’t work. (That’s Microsoft for ya, am I right? Ha ha!)\\nAnyway, I’d like to apologize for the things I wrote. I feel I’ve done both of us a disservice by refusing your generous offer to be a featured guest writer for Joel On Software.\\nIf you want to know the truth, my unwarranted outburst stems from a core insecurity. Had you rejected my article, I would have been crushed. I guess this was my way of rejecting you before you could reject me. Juvenile, I know.\\nIn fact I have deep respect for what you’ve done for the software development community over the past decade. I myself have been inspired by you since 2000; I can still remember the glee of getting new articles delivered to my inbox.\\nAs an entrepreneur, you’ve taught me everything from how to hire great people, how to think properly about bootstrapping, how new projects help you cope with burn-out, and even how to run tech support. In fact, there’s very little I do each day that isn’t influenced by you in some way.\\nThat’s incredible, if you think about it.\\nWhat I’m trying to say is, I would be honored to accept your invitation, and I trust that you will disregard my first email.\\nApologetically and humbly yours,  Jason Cohen\\n\\nHi Joel!\\nI haven’t heard from you, so I’m forwarding a copy of an email I sent earlier this week.\\nYou must get an ass-ton of email! So no hard feelings.\\nTalk to you soon,  Jason\\n\\nHi Joel,\\nOh man, that article about hanging the blinds at Fogcreek was awesome. Did you really do all that? Of course you did, it was in the photo! I loved how you tied in the army story—it’s really motivational.\\nI’m so glad Inc is featuring you. They need someone to speak truth to power and put the stuffed suits in their place. You’re like the Moses of software developers! What’s next, the New York Times? Why not!\\nSpeaking of articles, I’ve got some article ideas I’d love to discuss! I know you’re super-busy—that’s what I keep telling my friends. They’re such nervous nellies—they think you’re ignoring me! A quick little two-second reply from you would really reassure them. Thanks!\\n+1 for Joel in the NYT!  Jason\\n\\nJoel-\\nQuick idea: I was thinking of doing an interview series about how your writing has inspired successful software projects. Maybe even make a short film? You could attach it to your next “Interning at Fogcreek” DVD. What do you think?\\nHere’s what I’d say: Your three part series on designing software for real people permanently changed my perspective and continues to be my bible. It’s the kind of thing you have to re-read every few months to make sure you’re building great, usable software.\\nP.S. I still haven’t heard back about the guest post. Should I be worried?\\nThanks again,  J\\n\\nHey hey J-Spol!\\nI was just telling a friend about your offer. You know,\\xa0all I have to say is “Joel” and everyone knows exactly who I’m talking about. I guess that’s how you know you’ve made it!\\nAnyway, this friend thinks that if you were truly interested, we would have had more conversations by now. Imagine how surprised she’ll be when you publish my article! Ha ha, we’ll both get a kick out of that.\\nLet me know.\\nWaiting expectantly,  Your boy JC\\n\\nHi Joel,\\nThis will be my final email. I don’t want to seem like a stalker!\\nSo it turns out I have some influence over one of your interns (one of those friend-of-a-friend-who-owes-a-favor-to-a-friend type deals). He (or she!) set up me with a Copilot account behind the FogCreek firewall, so I’ve been playing with the Joel On Software CMS myself.\\nSeems like it’s a custom job. No problem—I’m Smart and I Get Things Done—I’ll figure it out.\\nSo you should see my article appear soon! I’m glad I found a way we could work together without interfering with your schedule.

Who could choose! I know, I know, settle down. Welcome to A/B testing.\\nAnyway, the next day you have this result:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVariant A  (“Code Review Tools”)\\nVariant B  (“Tools for Code Review”)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClicks:\\n31\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs this conclusive? Has A won? Or should you let the test run longer? Or should you try completely different text?\\nThe answer matters. If you wait too long between tests, you’re wasting time. If you don’t wait long enough for statistically conclusive results, you might think a variant is better and use that false assumption to create a new variant, and so forth, all on a wild goose chase! That’s not just a waste of time, it also prevents you from doing the correct thing, which is to come up with a completely new test.\\nNormally a formal statistical treatment would be too difficult, but I’m here to rescue you with a statistically sound yet incredibly simple formula that determines whether your A/B test results really are significant.\\nI’ll get to it in a minute, but I can’t help but include a more entertaining example than AdWords. Meet Hammy the Hamster, the probably-biased-but-incredibly-lovable tester of organic produce:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch on YouTube\\n\\n\\nIn the movie, Hammy chooses the organic produce 8 times and the conventional 4 times. This is an A/B test, just like with AdWords… but healthier.\\nIf you’re like me, you probably think “organic” is the clear-cut winner—after all Hammy chose it twice as often as conventional veggies.\\xa0But, as so often happens with probability and statistics, you’d be wrong.\\nThat’s because human beings are notoriously bad at guessing these things from gut feel. Most people are more afraid of dying in a plane crash than a car crash, even though the latter is 1000x more likely. On the other hand, we’re amazed when CNN “calls the election” for a governor with a mere 1% of the state ballots reporting in. We also can’t distinguish between patterns and noise.\\nOkay okay, we suck at math. So what’s the answer? Here’s the bit you’ve been waiting for1:\\n\\n1\\n For the mathematical derivation, see the end of the article.\\nDetermining whether an A/B test is statistically significant \\n\\nDefine\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\(N\\\\) as “the number of trials.”  \\u2028For Hammy, \\\\(N = 8+4 = \\\\mathbf{12}\\\\)  \\u2028For AdWords, \\\\(N = 31+19 = \\\\mathbf{50}\\\\) \\nDefine \\\\(D\\\\) as “half the difference between the ‘winner’ and the ’loser.’”  \\u2028For Hammy, \\\\(D = \\\\dfrac{8-4}{2}\\xa0= \\\\mathbf{2}\\\\)   \\u2028For AdWords, \\\\(D = \\\\dfrac{31-19}{2} = \\\\mathbf{6}\\\\) \\nThe test result is statistically significant only if \\\\(D^2 > N\\\\).  \\u2028For Hammy, \\\\(D^2 = 4\\\\), which is not bigger than \\\\(12\\\\), so it is not significant.  \\u2028For AdWords, \\\\(D^2 = 36\\\\), which is not bigger than \\\\(50\\\\), so it is not significant.\\n\\n\\nSo your AdWords test isn’t statistically significant yet. But you let the test continue to run. The next day you find 31 more clicks for variant A, and 19 more clicks for B. Rerunning the test, the measured difference is now significant:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVariant  A\\nVariant  B\\n\\\\(N\\\\)\\n\\\\(D\\\\)\\n\\\\(D^2\\\\)\\nStat  Sig?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDay one:\\n31\\n19\\n50\\n6\\n36\\nNo\\n\\n\\nDay two:\\n62\\n38\\n100\\n12\\n144\\nYes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA lot of times, though, you keep running the test and it’s still not significant. That’s when you realize you’re not learning anything new; the variants you picked are not meaningfully different for your readers. That means it’s time to come up with something new.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you start applying the formula to real-world examples, you’ll notice that when N is small, it is difficult—or even impossible—to be statistically significant. For example, say you’ve got one ad with 6 clicks and the other with 1. That’s \\\\(N = 7; D = 2.5; D^2 = 6.25\\\\). So the test is still inconclusive, even though A is beating B six-to-one. Trust the math here—with only a few data points, you really don’t know anything yet.\\nThe smaller the \\\\(N\\\\), the bigger the difference needs to be, to be detectable. Specifically, results are significant only if the ratio between A and B is larger than \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{N}+2}{\\\\sqrt{N}-2}\\\\). So for example, if \\\\(N = 50\\\\), as it was in our “day one A/B test” example, the winning variant needs to be almost double the number of clicks as the losing variant in order to have a detectable difference, e.g. a conversation rate of 10% versus 5%. This is a huge difference; it’s great if you find something so dramatically better, but this is rare, and therefore you can almost never find a significant A/B test given only 50 clicks to analyze.\\nWhen \\\\(N = 100\\\\), the winner needs to be at least 50% higher than the loser (which it was by the second day in our example). It takes \\\\(N = 1800\\\\) to detect the case where the winner is only 10% larger than the loser.\\nAnd this is bad news for A/B tests, because often one variant isn’t better than the other by more than 10%, e.g. a “2.4% conversion rate” versus a “2.2% conversion rate.” What does this mean, especially if you don’t have large N? It means you need to be seeking big differences, not subtle ones. Test wildly different designs, rather than tweaks. Tweaks can only be tested when \\\\(N\\\\) is enormous.\\nI hope this formula will help you make the right choices when running A/B tests. It’s simple enough that you have no excuse not to apply it! Human intuition sucks when it comes to these things, and A/B testing tools often use misleading or incorrect math, so let this formula help you draw the right conclusions.\\xa0\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\nEndnote for the mathematically inclined: The derivation \\nThe null-hypothesis is that the results of the A/B test are due to chance alone. The statistical test we need is Pearson’s chi-squared2.\\n\\n2\\n Not the Student t-test as is commonly claimed by people online who have only a passing familiarity with statistics; the t-test is appropriate with continuous, normally-distributed random variables, whereas \\\\(\\\\chi^2\\\\) is appropriate for categorical random variables from independent trials and arbitrary probability distributions, which is what an A/B test is.\\nThe definition of the \\\\(\\\\chi^2\\\\) statistic follows, where:\\n\\\\(m\\\\) = number of possible outcomes;  \\\\(O_k\\\\) = observed quantity of results in category \\\\(k\\\\);  \\\\(E_k\\\\) = expected quantity of results in category \\\\(k\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\\\chi^2 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\\\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}\\\\]\\nIn the simple case of a two-variant A/B test, m = 2. \\\\(O_1\\\\) and \\\\(O_2\\\\) are the observed results, and definitionally \\\\(N = O_1 + O_2\\\\). The expected result under the null-hypothesis is that the quantities fall equally into each category, therefore \\\\(E_1 = E_2 =\\xa0N/2\\\\).\\nPlugging this into the definition:\\n\\\\[\\\\chi^2 = \\\\frac{(O_1 - \\\\frac{N}{2})^2}{\\\\frac{N}{2}} + \\\\frac{(O_2 - \\\\frac{N}{2})^2}{\\\\frac{N}{2}}\\\\]\\nThe first numerator can be rewritten in terms of \\\\(O_1\\\\) and \\\\(O_2\\\\) by substituting \\\\(N = O_1 + O_2\\\\), and this results in our variable \\\\(D^2\\\\) as defined in the main text:\\n\\\\[\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\left(O_1 - \\\\frac{N}{2} \\\\right)^2 &= \\\\left(O_1 - \\\\frac{O_1 + O_2}{2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{2O_1 - O_1 - O_2}{2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{O_1 - O_2}{2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\\\\\\\n&= D^2\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\\\]\\nWe can repeat with the second numerator, and so the expression simplifies:\\n\\\\[\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\chi^2 &= \\\\frac{(O_1 - \\\\frac{N}{2})^2}{\\\\frac{N}{2}} + \\\\frac{(O_2 - \\\\frac{N}{2})^2}{\\\\frac{N}{2}} \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\frac{D^2}{\\\\frac{N}{2}} + \\\\frac{D^2}{\\\\frac{N}{2}} \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\frac{2}{N}(2D^2) \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\frac{4D^2}{N}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\\\]\\nNow that we have a simple formula for the chi-squared statistic, we refer to the chi-squared distribution to determine statistical significance. Specifically: What is the probability this result would have happened by chance alone?\\nLooking at the distribution at 1 degree of freedom, we must exceed 3.8 for 95% confidence and 6.6 for 99% confidence. For this simplified rule-of-thumb formula, I selected 4 as the critical threshold.

But 2x better is possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZappos COO Alfred Lin enlightens us on how to become 37 times more productive in only one year! Can it be?\\nLet’s hear him out:\\n\\nMake at least one improvement [every day] that makes Zappos better. It sounds daunting,\\xa0but remember improvements don’t have to be dramatic. Think about what it means to improve just 1% per day and build upon that every single day. Doing so has a dramatic effect and will make us 37x better, not 365% (3.65x) better at the end of the year. Wake up every day and ask yourself not only what is the 1% improvement I can change to make Zappos better, but also what is the 1% improvement I can change to make myself better personally and professionally—because we, Zappos, can’t grow unless we as individual people grow too.\\nImagine yourself making 1% changes every day that compounds and will make you and Zappos 37x better by the end of the year. Imagine if every employee at Zappos was doing the same. Imagine how much better you, Zappos and the\\xa0world will be next year.\\n\\nAt first glance it’s inspiring. At second glance it’s poppycock. At third glance you wonder how it’s possible for someone to use the word “Zappos” so frequently.\\nBeing 37x more productive is impossible, and I’ll show you why. But along the way it will become clear how becoming 2-3x more productive might be within reach.\\nHis math isn’t the problem per se. It’s true that if you improve 1% each day over the previous day, that’s a 1% compounding rate. My question is: Is it possible to increase your daily productivity by an entire percent every day?\\nWell, if you can do only 1 pushup, then I believe that you could improve about 1% per day, and end the year being able to do 37 pushups at a time.\\nBut then, it continues. The next year you continue getting 1% better per day, and by the end of the year you can do 1369 pushups in one day. Yeah.\\nThings rare compound like that, even at slow rates. Or at least, there are other factors that overwhelm that factor.\\nBut, is there a smart way to, say, 2x our productivity? (Once!)\\nTo answer that, I want to give you a fun math puzzle. Yeah, I know, “fun” is relative… Okay look if you don’t like word problems just take a random guess at the answer. If you’re up for the challenge, try to solve it without pen and paper. You know, just to prove your MIT education wasn’t for nothing.\\nHere’s the puzzle: You get in your car at home and head out towards your mother’s house 60 miles away. (Your mom likes this word problem, I can already tell.) You hit traffic during the first half of the trip, so after 30 miles you’ve averaged only 30 miles per hour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the traffic opens up and you can go as fast as you want. The question is: How fast do you have to go during the second half of the trip such that you’ve averaged 60 mph over the entire trip?\\nIf you’re not using pen and paper, maybe you guessed 90? 120?\\nActually it’s impossible! To average 60 mph you need to travel the whole 60 miles in a single hour. But it’s already been an hour! \\xa0Even if you went 1000 mph during the second half, it would have taken just over an hour to complete the 60 miles, therefore your average is still less than 60 mph.\\nIt’s amazing how periods of low velocity wash away gains of high velocity. In the puzzle, if you doubled your speed in the second half it would increase your trip average from 30 to 40 mph. If you\\xa0quadrupled your speed in the second half, your trip average would still be only 48 mph.\\nOnce you’re behind, you can’t make up ground no matter how fast you go.\\nThis puzzle illustrates the weird math of velocities, and what applies to “miles” per hour also applies to emails per hour or writing code or writing prose or any other “gettin’ stuff done” per hour.\\nThe problem with improving your productivity is that so much of your day is occupied by low-velocity activity—dealing with emails you didn’t really need to see, dawdling in a meeting that hasn’t started yet, or spending too much time reading blogs. (Present company excepted.)\\nWhen half your day moves at 30 mph, it’s impossible to make up the time during the other half.\\nThis is the problem with Lin’s 1% idea—the low-velocity stuff makes it too difficult to improve even 1% overall, at least not every day of the year. Even with 37x improvement in some areas, you still might not be 2x more productive overall.\\nThere’s good news here, however! Once you realize that the low-velocity stuff is responsible for most of the drag on your productivity, you realize that the thing to do is eliminate the low-velocity stuff. Yes it’s good to learn to type faster, but cutting down on the time it takes to process useless email might help even more.\\nReady for more good news? There are free tools that help you identify what the low-velocity stuff is. I use one called RescueTime. To show you how useful this is, consider this example of my stats for one week:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhoa—almost eight hours of email. That’s a solid, uninterrupted, full day of nothing but email I’m blowing through every week. Is that really the way I should be spending the majority of my time?\\nEven the long tail can be instructive. Notice the 45 minutes of “Calendars.” A drill-down bears out the awful conclusion—yes I spent almost an hour in Google Calendar. It’s true this week was completely packed with events, but still.\\nAnother realization: I had an averaged 5.5 hours of activity per day. I was in the office for over 8 hours every one of those days—the rest is sopped up with meetings, office chatter, and lunch. Here’s the mythical eight-hour workday quantified—I’m starting with 5-6 and even then I spent much of it fielding email.\\nOnce you see the numbers it’s easy to correct. I now notice more when I’m in an office conversation that’s past the point of being productive. There’s millions of tips for how to process email more efficiently.\\nSo if you’re serious about wanting to increase productivity by, say, 2x, you can. Identify the biggest perpetrators of low-velocity activity and eliminate them, then do a little surgery on your high-value tasks.\\nThe best part is, none of this means working late or working harder. Just stop averaging down!\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/double-your-productivity/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDouble your productivity without more work or stress\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

You can’t do everything. So don’t.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m a habitual procrastinator. It’s a fundamental component of my psyche. It’s also an important factor in success at running a small business. Here’s why.\\nIn a small company you’re overwhelmed with things to do. At Smart Bear we still have a dense whiteboard full of marketing ideas we don’t have time for, dozens of index cards with cool features we don’t have time to implement, and 7,000 open issues and minor feature requests in Fogbugz we don’t even have time to glance at.\\nAnd that’s now, with five years of work and fifteen employees. It was hundred times worse at the beginning with just one person doing all the work.\\nThis one person must have worked tirelessly. (He did.) This person must have been willing to do every kind of job. (He was.) This person must have been hyper-organized, allowing nothing to slip through the cracks, spending precious time on only the most high-valued tasks, not just working on whatever this person felt like at the time. (Ummmmmm… <looks sheepishly at toes>… not so much.)\\n“Don’t put off ’till tomorrow what you can put off ’till the day after tomorrow.” Thanks, Mark, for guiding the overwhelmed.\\nYou really do have too much to do. Prioritization might be best in theory, but plain, gut-feel procrastination might be the right way to go.\\xa0\\nMany things blow over if you just ignore them. The big feature you got worked up about yesterday seems unimportant in the cold light of today. A feature a customer says is vital turns out to be something suggested by their intern, not something actually stopping a sale. An apparent fundamental bug turns out to be a misconfiguration. An important meeting turns out to be unimportant.\\nBesides, a lot of those tasks aren’t as important as you think. Even something critical like accounting can be put off. Late fees, lost receipts, penalties from the IRS: financial burdens more than compensated by additional revenue gained by signing up one more customer.\\nFinancial tasks in particular also have the property of being faster to do in a big sweep rather than as they trickle in. It’s faster to enter 100 receipts into Quickbooks once a month than to enter three a day. Little tasks like that still have context-switch overhead, plus you get fast at typing and keyboard shortcuts when you’re doing the same action hundreds of times in a row.\\nFinally, sometimes you’ve got to let yourself do fun stuff at the expense of priorities. Most of what you do in a little company isn’t what you enjoy doing; it’s easy to become frustrated and burned-out. So sometimes you need to allow yourself to recover with plain fun. Whatever the cost of putting off duties, burn-out is even more costly.\\nYeah I know I’m rationalizing. But you can’t do everything, so don’t.\\nAnd don’t beat yourself up over it.\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/procrastinate/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nProcrastinate for Success!\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

The typical software sales strategy is #1. It’s often applied to get the customer to “close” before the end of the month or quarter or some other arbitrary time boundary.\\nAt first blush it seems harder to persuade with #2. After all, #1 means the customer pays less than #2, because #2 isn’t a real discount—it’s a discount against an imagined future price.\\nBut for me, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of #2. Here’s why, from the point of view of the customer.\\nIn strategy #1 there’s a discount if I “act now.” Hmm, so that means the “price” wasn’t really the price after all. The “price” must have included a nice slice of pure profit that apparently you’re willing to forego. So you were gouging me before? And the only reason I found out about it is that it happens to be the end of the quarter?\\nThus #1 breeds mistrust—the opposite of what you’re trying to establish with me, your customer. In #2 you’re looking out for my interests1. You’re cluing me in that there might be a rate increase, and you’re actively protecting me from it. Sure, I know there may not be an increase, or it may not come for a while. But it’s still protection, not a gouge that you graciously chose to reveal.\\n\\n1\\n This is an example of the “Love” type of WTP (Willingness-to-pay)\\nFour years ago I was trialing .TEST from Parasoft. It was buggy; even after hours of remote desktop control with tech support we couldn’t get it to stay up long enough to scan my code.\\nBut the salesman was persistent. The conversation went like this, minus many minutes of sales-filler-language on his end of the phone:\\n\\n“How much will this cost me?”\\n“$20,000.”\\n“Wow, I thought you were going to say $2,000. That’s way out of my price range for one person and this product. In fact, I’ve looked at FxCop and NUnit and it seems to me I can do the same thing with free tools. I was willing to pay for some convenience, but not that much.”\\n“Let me see what I can do.”\\n“No nevermind, it’s, like, an order of magnitude problem.”\\n\\nHe called back the next day.\\n\\n“$1,500.”\\n\\nI didn’t buy. I talked to someone who did, though. A reference customer. That guy said he paid $20,000. I asked how he liked it and whether he encountered the crash problems I was seeing. He said they hadn’t installed it yet, but the demo looked great. I made a mental note to try to understand the mentality and budget that forks out $20,000 for a nice demo.\\nBut getting back to the point. If he can go from $20,000 to $1,500, maybe he will go to $1,000. Yes, this strategy means often you will extract extra money from me. But it also means I don’t know where the floor is, and I have every incentive to haggle. The process drags out, ending at gunpoint. Meanwhile your “customer relationship” is now more of a “hostage situation.”\\nSo let me get this straight: It’s better to get an extra 10% on every order, but create an adversarial environment with me, your cherished customer? This is enterprise sales, right, where the pilot is 30 seats and the roll-out is 2,000? And you’re going to risk pissing me off over 10% on the 30-seat part?\\nAnd now imagine if I had called back that reference customer and told him he could’ve had it for $1,500? Yet another problem with discounting—word gets around, meaningless differences in pricing is unfair, and now I, the customer, see you as plain old dishonest.\\nGoodbye 2,000-seat order.\\nEven if we set the honesty/relationship argument aside, there’s the matter of image.\\nWhat kind of company provides a discount? Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens. Try to get quotes for Microsoft or Oracle or IBM products for 1000 desktops. Everything’s negotiable, everything’s discountable. At best it conjures images of haggling and struggle; at worst of low-quality or the desperate need to “meet numbers” at the expense of everything else.\\nWhich companies don’t discount, ever? Apple, Google, Constant Contact. No discounts on iPhones. No haggling over AdWord prices. What’s the image? Desirable. The best. Worth paying for. The leader doesn’t have to compromise. The leader isn’t desperate for orders.\\nStrategy #2 implies growth. You’ve planted “higher prices” in my head now. “Supply” in software is unlimited, so that must mean “demand” is increasing. The customer won’t go through that calculus, but it certainly feels like the product is becoming more valuable. Discounts feel like unloading unwanted product; price increases feel like success.\\nStrategy #2 implies I’m part of a club. I’ve gotten in early, on the ground floor, before the product explodes in popularity and prices go up. And I’m rewarded for this support and loyalty with price protection. A “thank-you” from because I was part of it, because I was there before you were big and expensive, because I took that risk with you. That’s actually a good reason to give some a discount, and here you are, proactively giving it.\\nSo there it is. #1 means less money now, an adversarial relationship, a never-ending struggle over money, and a message that maybe the product needs a discount to be desirable. #2 means more money now, a consistent and fair pricing policy, an inclusive, special customer relationship, and a message of market leadership and growth.\\nSo why do 90% of software companies pick #1?\\n\\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\\nhttps://longform.asmartbear.com/discount-gambit/\\n© 2007-2024 Jason Cohen\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 @asmartbear\\n\\n\\n\\n☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe for more, andThank you for sharing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDiscount gambit\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 of 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't miss the next article.\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Subscribe\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for sharing this article:\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nThreads\\nEmail\\nCopy Link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo ads.

As a four-time entrepreneur across 24 years, both bootstrapped and VC-funded, resulting in two exits and two unicorns, I’ve also been writing about everything I know for 17 years. I hope you’ll find it useful and entertaining.\\nMostly to support a new startup, I occasionally do short advisory calls through TalkWithMe.\\nFounder \\nWP Engine \\nCurrently I’m the Chief Innovation Officer of WP Engine, which I started in 2010, bootstrapped for two years, then raised a few small rounds, then together with our amazing CEO Heather Brunner a few large rounds totaling over $300M, fueled hyper-growth to a unicorn with 1,200 employees across eight global offices, serving many billions of web requests daily for 200,000 customers as one of the top-ten largest web platforms in the world, and our name on a downtown building that I remember seeing from my car seat growing up in Austin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmart Bear \\nPrior, I bootstrapped Smart Bear for seven years, built it to millions in profit, and sold it in 2007. It changed hands again in 2017 for $450m and in 2020 for nearly $2B. I can’t take credit for the success it enjoyed after I left in 2009, but it certainly had a good foundation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow a conglomerate of beloved software quality products, originally we invented the modern methodology and software for peer code reviews—software developers reviewing each others work, just like authors and editors at a newspaper. I “wrote the book” about code reviews; in the process we conducted the largest in situ study of 2,500 code reviews at Cisco.\\nIT Watchdogs \\nBefore that, co-founder of IT Watchdogs, a hardware + embedded software company making server-room climate and power monitors, which was also bootstrapped and profitable, sold in 2004 and is still producing its products under parent company Vertive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestor \\nSince 2009 I’ve been an investor and time-permitting mentor at Capital Factory, Austin’s major incubator and startup co-working space. I’ve invested in a few companies including AgentPronto, Alto, Apptronik, Armbrust Masks, Builder Prime, Cart.com, Cratejoy, Osano, Pingboard, Signup.com, SpareFoot, StackOverflow, StormPulse, SureSwift, SwimTopia, and Vitag. (And others that didn’t work out, but I’m no less proud to have been a small part of the journey.)\\nSpeaker \\nSome folks enjoy my talks on bootstrapping and startups over the past decade. These are the favorites:\\n\\nDesigning the Ideal Bootstrapped Business\\nVideo from Microconf 2013\\nHealthy, Wealthy, and Wise (lessons in burn-out on the way to $100M ARR)\\nVideo from Business of Software 2017; Video from SaaStr Feb 2018\\nHow data makes you do the wrong thing\\nVideo from Business of Software 2012\\nNaked Business: How Honesty Makes Money\\nVideo from Business of Software 2011, or YouTube from Microconf 2012\\nA Geek Sifts Through the Bullshit\\nVideo from WebStock 2011\\nWhen to break the rules and ignore advice\\nVideo from Business of Software 2010\\n\\nSpecial links \\n\\nSingle PDF with all articles, newest first.\\nRSS in “newsletter” order, both new articles and cleaned-up older posts.\\nRSS in published-date order, newest first.\\n\\nCredits \\nThe cartoons are by the prolific Mark Anderson of Andertoons.

       "\"Product/Market Fit (PMF): Experience & Data LinkCopied A Smart Bear » Product/Market Fit (PMF): Experience & Data All Articles Author Moon Sun All Articles Author Subscribe Jason Cohen November 5, 2023 Reading time: 11 min Printable PDF Product/Market Fit (PMF): Experience & Data by Jason Cohen on November 5, 2023 Companies that achieve Product/Market Fit – both self-funded and VC-funded – exhibit the same prototypical metrics curves and subjective experiences. source Every day people debate how to define “Product/Market Fit.” It’s best to start with the subjective experience, because there is no doubt when you have it. (If you’re not sure whether you have Product/Market Fit, you don’t.) If every day it’s a struggle to get customers, it’s not working yet. If every day it’s a struggle to keep up with demand, it’s working. It is a momentum change from “push” to “pull”—a change from fighting for each customer, one at a time, to a flood of signups that you can’t even explain. It’s a change from “how do we get more customers” to “how do we handle the influx of demand?” It’s working. Something clicked, like a final puzzle piece snapping into place, a “fit,” and suddenly the floodgates are open. It’s not all good. The avalanche of customer complaints outstrip your ability to deliver bug fixes and simple enhancements. You feel behind in every department simultaneously; you can’t keep up with the work no matter how “productive” you are. You obviously should hire someone—and this new revenue means you can afford it—but who? Someone just like you, because you can manage them, or someone who complements you, so you can deal with the burgeoning scale? Does it even matter—you don’t have time to interview. It’s the proverbial “good problem to have,” but it doesn’t feel good in the moment, with a crushing workload and unhappy new customers, and your brand slipping away (“I heard they were good but it took them a day to answer my support question” says the public review). Although of course it is the best problem to have. You might think all this doesn’t matter—you’re just running your company; who cares how some article defines some term like “Product/Market Fit?” But it does matter, because it determines whether the company is sustainable, and fundamentally changes how you operate each day, how you plan for the future, whether and who you need to hire, and what you need to build, and whether you’re going to start tackling scale. (P.S. How do you go from idea to this state? This is my PMF system that I used to build a unicorn.) What does Product/Market Fit look like numerically? In my experience building several companies myself and angel-investing in dozens of others (with a wide range of outcomes), I define Product/Market Fit as all of the following: Easy growth (pull, not push): Growth rate suddenly spikes up, and sustains at the new rate. You often don’t know why. High retention: Cancellation under 3%/mo (for B2B) or 5%/mo (for B2C), because if customers are leaving in droves, you are not a “fit.” Critical mass: At least $20,000/mo in revenue or increasing WAU’s by at least 200/mo. Everyone can grow 1000% month-of-month when the baseline is 7 customers; the fact that you have only 7 customers means there’s not yet evidence of “fit1.” 1 What if you have a single huge customer? Congratulations, lots of people would love to have a huge customer; great start. That demonstrates you have fit for a single customer, but not for a market; that’s consulting, not product. What follows are the data to back up this definition, that also matches the lived experience which is really the essence of hitting Product/Market Fit, where life will never be the same again. ☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜ The characteristic growth curve of “Product/Market Fit” Bootstrapped products When you see growth charts like Pallyy’s, you can see the exact moment when Product/Market Fit was reached: source Pallyy’s four-year MRR Successful startups often have a growth curve like Pallyy’s: Revenue growing linearly, slowly, often for about two years, then in a moment—Product/Market fit—when it suddenly turns upward, and continues growing at that new trajectory. The new growth is still linear, but dramatically faster. In particular, it is not exponential, though that’s the word people frequently use (this universal fallacy is explained here). ConvertKit was similar, bumping along for two years before growing quickly but linearly, just like Pallyy: source ConvertKit’s early MRR growth And then that growth continued linearly, not “exponentially” as many pundits like to say: source ConvertKit’s scale-up MRR growth You can see the sudden change between “every sale is a struggle” and “the orders just won’t stop coming in.” ConvertKit founder Nathan Barry famously tells the story of how he personally reached out one by one to his ideal target customers, manually onboarding them to not only get the sale but to get the testimonial2. It’s a brilliant playbook that others would be wise to copy. It’s also what it means to hard-scrabble for customers, and it’s really obvious when the forces flipping from having to scratch and claw for every dollar of revenue, to the company running away from him. 2 I was one of them; perhaps you’re reading this article because of an email from my newsletter, which is still on ConvertKit. VC-funded products These companies were bootstrapped, but the it’s same in the world of venture, because Product/Market Fit is about products and markets and customers and fits, not about funding models. My company WP Engine started 14 years ago self-funded but two years later became VC-funded, eventually raising more than $300M, experiencing hyper-growth3 for a decade, yet it exhibits the same two-year slow-growth preamble to high-growth, and both linear: 3 Often defined as 2T3D, i.e. in successive years after attaining $1M in annual revenue, the company’s revenue triples, triples, doubles, doubles, and doubles, thereby getting close to $100M five years later; WP Engine did that and more, starting with 5x. WP Engine’s early growth curve You can’t tell from the chart when we first raised money (it wasn’t January of 2012), nor subsequent rounds, nor the size of the rounds. The shape of growth is a force that transcends all of it. I distinctly remember when we flipped to “Product/Market Fit.” Only five of us, completely sustainable, and suddenly everything changed. We fell behind on our stellar tech support; one of the dangers of bragging about how “the founder does Zendesk tickets” is that process doesn’t scale. We couldn’t keep up with our free white-glove site-migration service for new customers. And then, completely behind on all work, trying to stand up new servers and answer phone calls, knowing we needed to hire, we got even more behind because hiring takes time—finding candidates, interviewing, not wanting to hire the wrong person just because we’re moving fast, and even after we hired, there’s no documentation or training, so we’re just working side by side, hoping folks learn by osmosis, while the team gets even further behind. And customers were complaining on Twitter that our service is going downhill—and worst of all, they were right. They blamed it on us raising money; what they didn’t know is we hadn’t spent a dollar of it yet; in fact our error was not spending the money on hiring ahead of need, to blunt the impact of a growth increase. We did get back on top of it later in the year, and we’ve won all sorts of awards for our service, maintaining 98% CSAT to this day, because that’s who we are. But that’s not what it felt like in 2012. The same thing happens to the “cool kids” companies in Y-Combinator: source Anonymous YC company growth chart from YC co-founder Paul Graham This isn’t a new phenomenon, nor a “SaaS” phenomenon. Peldi Guilizzoni famously shared his (one-time!) revenue for Balsamiq Mockups back in 2008: source Balsamiq Markups one-time (not SaaS!) revenue, 2008 Second products Hubspot is a hyper-growth VC-funded company, now public. Early on, you can see the linear behavior, fairly consistent even through the 2008 recession, as co-founder Dharmesh Shah indicates on a chart from his personal blog: source Hubspot’s early growth curve Sometimes there’s another shift in the slope of the line, when the company adds a second successful product, expands to a lucrative new market, or changes its business model. Hubspot, after twelve years of linear growth, changes to a new (but still linear) growth rate around 2021, around the time their second product-line reached its own fit: source Hubspot’s at-scale growth curve, exhibiting a bend, and linear on both sides of the change Viral products All of the previous examples were of B2B companies without “viral” or “network” effects, which are often associated with so-called “exponential growth.” However, even classic “viral growth” examples like Slack (at the time the fastest-ever-growing B2B company in history) and Facebook (at the time the fastest-ever-growing B2C company in history) did not grow exponentially. Instead, they grew in the same way again: linear, then a sudden change, then still linear but faster. Here’s Slack, which looks exactly like Hubspot: source Slack’s early user growth curve And Facebook with a material bend in early 2009 (coinciding with the introduction of the “like” button): source Facebook’s early user growth curve Elsewhere, I’ve gone into great detail about why even viral products like Slack and Facebook specifically don’t grow exponentially. You can also see it in AirBnB with a bend in late 2010, coinciding with the realization that professional photography was the key to “fitting” with customer expectations: source Airbnb’s final piece of the puzzle Media products While I do think it’s more usual for media and social media to have a longer, slower curve, sometimes you see the Product/Market Fit pop, like Lenny Rachitsky’s newsletter: source Lenny’s Newsletter traffic Oh, and what did he do to cause that sudden growth? You guessed it: source The bottom line is, these growth curves matching “fit” are common with all business models—B2B and B2C, recurring-revenue or one-time revenue, products or media, self-funded or VC-funded. High cancellation means there’s no fit There is one killer metric that will stop growth in its tracks, even with the curves above: Cancellation. ☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜ Founders often think cancellation of 5-7% per month is OK so long as they’re getting lots of new customers. But they are mistaken. High cancellation puts a ceiling on growth. This is on public display with Buffer, who started with the same sort of linear-change-linear growth curve (2012-2014, then 2014-2020), but then growth leveled off (2020) and never returned (and even shrunk): source Buffer’s ARR The reason is churn. Note how churn was higher during the slow-growth period of 2012-2014, then reduced to 5%/month, permitting faster growth: source Buffer’s monthly cancellation rate But 5% is still too high; there’s no way to keep increasing new-customer acquisition to outpace churn, for the simple reason that “5%/mo” definitionally grows in lock-step with your total size, but marketing and sales does not continue to automatically grow just because your company is bigger. So, cancellations always win that race, and at 5%/mo, you top out pretty quickly: source Buffer’s unit economics; new-MRR naturally tops out, whereas cancellation never stops growing in absolute dollars. You can see a similar effect at SparkToro, an impressive company that is a testament to founder Rand Fishkin’s vision to build a great company instead of a company that attempts to accelerate growth forever; he explains how SparkToro generates enviable profit, with happy employees, happy customers, and happy investors. So this isn’t an indictment of the company, but it is a demonstration of the growth-destroying power of high cancellation rates: source SparkToro is consistent in adding the same dollars-per-month of new-MRR, but their consistent cancellation rate continues to grow in dollars per month, which means at their current size, cancellation “wins” that race, and growth becomes flat. It’s not actually about finances; it’s the fact that customers are choosing to leave. The numbers are the objective measure that this is happening, but they’re not the point. The point is that customers don’t want to stay. That means it’s not a fit. Therefore, both because “lots of customers leaving means it’s not a fit” and because high cancellations means the growth curve will quickly flatten, cancellation higher than 3% for B2B or 5% for B2C indicates a lack of Product/Market Fit. Easy inbound growth is indeed a sign of fit, but if customers leave in droves, it means the promise was right, the price was right, but the product didn’t deliver, or the customer’s need was too brief to sustain a recurring-revenue business. Some people call this “a fit, but not sustainable” or “a fit, just with limited upside.” I call it a lack of fit, because if customers are leaving, it’s not a fit4. Don’t get distracted by dollars. Pay attention to customer behavior. 4 See this amazing five-minute segment from founder of Twitch Michael Seibel, describing how his Socialcam app got 60M downloads in 4 months and top-5 on the App Store, yet retention was so horrible (almost zero retained users after 10 days) that despite that inconceivable growth, it was not Product/Market Fit. If your company is growing slowly, that doesn’t mean you failed. It just means you haven’t hit that success curve yet, and haven’t found Product/Market Fit. Maybe you never will, but you’ll grind out a profitable company anyway. Maybe you never will, and growth is so slow, it’s best to face facts, stop, figure out why it was too hard, and try something else. Or maybe your growth spurt will start today. Maybe if you just follow my roadmap to Product/Market Fit, which I used to build a unicorn, you will succeed. Then again, in that same article I explain that my previous startup only used half of those ideas. No one knows; that’s life. But now you know what it looks like, when it is truly a fit.

       "\"Discount gambit LinkCopied A Smart Bear » Discount gambit All Articles Author Moon Sun All Articles Author Subscribe Jason Cohen March 22, 2008 Reading time: 5 min Printable PDF Discount gambit by Jason Cohen on March 22, 2008 Discounting is the typical sales technique, but refusing to discount can lead to a much better business, even in the Enterprise. source Which of these pricing strategies is more persuasive? If you buy now, I’ll give you a discount. The price is going up, but if you buy now I will lock in your rate. Both are types of discount. The typical software sales strategy is #1. It’s often applied to get the customer to “close” before the end of the month or quarter or some other arbitrary time boundary. At first blush it seems harder to persuade with #2. After all, #1 means the customer pays less than #2, because #2 isn’t a real discount—it’s a discount against an imagined future price. But for me, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of #2. Here’s why, from the point of view of the customer. In strategy #1 there’s a discount if I “act now.” Hmm, so that means the “price” wasn’t really the price after all. The “price” must have included a nice slice of pure profit that apparently you’re willing to forego. So you were gouging me before? And the only reason I found out about it is that it happens to be the end of the quarter? Thus #1 breeds mistrust—the opposite of what you’re trying to establish with me, your customer. In #2 you’re looking out for my interests1. You’re cluing me in that there might be a rate increase, and you’re actively protecting me from it. Sure, I know there may not be an increase, or it may not come for a while. But it’s still protection, not a gouge that you graciously chose to reveal. 1 This is an example of the “Love” type of WTP (Willingness-to-pay) Four years ago I was trialing .TEST from Parasoft. It was buggy; even after hours of remote desktop control with tech support we couldn’t get it to stay up long enough to scan my code. But the salesman was persistent. The conversation went like this, minus many minutes of sales-filler-language on his end of the phone: “How much will this cost me?” “$20,000.” “Wow, I thought you were going to say $2,000. That’s way out of my price range for one person and this product. In fact, I’ve looked at FxCop and NUnit and it seems to me I can do the same thing with free tools. I was willing to pay for some convenience, but not that much.” “Let me see what I can do.” “No nevermind, it’s, like, an order of magnitude problem.” He called back the next day. “$1,500.” I didn’t buy. I talked to someone who did, though. A reference customer. That guy said he paid $20,000. I asked how he liked it and whether he encountered the crash problems I was seeing. He said they hadn’t installed it yet, but the demo looked great. I made a mental note to try to understand the mentality and budget that forks out $20,000 for a nice demo. But getting back to the point. If he can go from $20,000 to $1,500, maybe he will go to $1,000. Yes, this strategy means often you will extract extra money from me. But it also means I don’t know where the floor is, and I have every incentive to haggle. The process drags out, ending at gunpoint. Meanwhile your “customer relationship” is now more of a “hostage situation.” So let me get this straight: It’s better to get an extra 10% on every order, but create an adversarial environment with me, your cherished customer? This is enterprise sales, right, where the pilot is 30 seats and the roll-out is 2,000? And you’re going to risk pissing me off over 10% on the 30-seat part? And now imagine if I had called back that reference customer and told him he could’ve had it for $1,500? Yet another problem with discounting—word gets around, meaningless differences in pricing is unfair, and now I, the customer, see you as plain old dishonest. Goodbye 2,000-seat order. Even if we set the honesty/relationship argument aside, there’s the matter of image. What kind of company provides a discount? Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens. Try to get quotes for Microsoft or Oracle or IBM products for 1000 desktops. Everything’s negotiable, everything’s discountable. At best it conjures images of haggling and struggle; at worst of low-quality or the desperate need to “meet numbers” at the expense of everything else. Which companies don’t discount, ever? Apple, Google, Constant Contact. No discounts on iPhones. No haggling over AdWord prices. What’s the image? Desirable. The best. Worth paying for. The leader doesn’t have to compromise. The leader isn’t desperate for orders. Strategy #2 implies growth. You’ve planted “higher prices” in my head now. “Supply” in software is unlimited, so that must mean “demand” is increasing. The customer won’t go through that calculus, but it certainly feels like the product is becoming more valuable. Discounts feel like unloading unwanted product; price increases feel like success. Strategy #2 implies I’m part of a club. I’ve gotten in early, on the ground floor, before the product explodes in popularity and prices go up. And I’m rewarded for this support and loyalty with price protection. A “thank-you” from because I was part of it, because I was there before you were big and expensive, because I took that risk with you. That’s actually a good reason to give some a discount, and here you are, proactively giving it. So there it is. #1 means less money now, an adversarial relationship, a never-ending struggle over money, and a message that maybe the product needs a discount to be desirable. #2 means more money now, a consistent and fair pricing policy, an inclusive, special customer relationship, and a message of market leadership and growth. So why do 90% of software companies pick #1?

While there are other roads to Product/Market Fit, consider copying some of these ideas. source What is the formula for going from an initial product idea to Product/Market Fit—a company that is growing and sustainable, with customers that want to pay and want to stay.

Then we’ll explore the other truth—that it often doesn’t work like this after all. Personal Fit: “Passion” is useful, but winning requires a personal edge. Market Fit: Most good ideas aren’t good businesses. Customer Fit: Talk to customers before you waste months building the wrong thing. Build and ship the SLC quickly: It’s where the real learning happens. Marketing and Sales more than writing code and tweaking design. Retention-driven Product development; attend to your existing customers first. Prioritize systematically, ruthlessly, strategically. Manage your psychology on a journey of self-discovery and constant rejection. 1.

As a four-time entrepreneur across 24 years, both bootstrapped and VC-funded, resulting in two exits and two unicorns, I’ve also been writing about everything I know for 17 years. I hope you’ll find it useful and entertaining. Mostly to support a new startup, I occasionally do short advisory calls through TalkWithMe. Founder WP Engine Currently I’m the Chief Innovation Officer of WP Engine, which I started in 2010, bootstrapped for two years, then raised a few small rounds, then together with our amazing CEO Heather Brunner a few large rounds totaling over $300M, fueled hyper-growth to a unicorn with 1,200 employees across eight global offices, serving many billions of web requests daily for 200,000 customers as one of the top-ten largest web platforms in the world, and our name on a downtown building that I remember seeing from my car seat growing up in Austin. Smart Bear Prior, I bootstrapped Smart Bear for seven years, built it to millions in profit, and sold it in 2007. It changed hands again in 2017 for $450m and in 2020 for nearly $2B. I can’t take credit for the success it enjoyed after I left in 2009, but it certainly had a good foundation. Now a conglomerate of beloved software quality products, originally we invented the modern methodology and software for peer code reviews—software developers reviewing each others work, just like authors and editors at a newspaper. I “wrote the book” about code reviews; in the process we conducted the largest in situ study of 2,500 code reviews at Cisco. IT Watchdogs Before that, co-founder of IT Watchdogs, a hardware + embedded software company making server-room climate and power monitors, which was also bootstrapped and profitable, sold in 2004 and is still producing its products under parent company Vertive. Investor Since 2009 I’ve been an investor and time-permitting mentor at Capital Factory, Austin’s major incubator and startup co-working space. I’ve invested in a few companies including AgentPronto, Alto, Apptronik, Armbrust Masks, Builder Prime, Cart.com, Cratejoy, Osano, Pingboard, Signup.com, SpareFoot, StackOverflow, StormPulse, SureSwift, SwimTopia, and Vitag. (And others that didn’t work out, but I’m no less proud to have been a small part of the journey.) Speaker Some folks enjoy my talks on bootstrapping and startups over the past decade.

As a four-time entrepreneur across 24 years, both bootstrapped and VC-funded, resulting in two exits and two unicorns, I’ve also been writing about everything I know for 17 years. I hope you’ll find it useful and entertaining. Mostly to support a new startup, I occasionally do short advisory calls through TalkWithMe. Founder WP Engine Currently I’m the Chief Innovation Officer of WP Engine, which I started in 2010, bootstrapped for two years, then raised a few small rounds, then together with our amazing CEO Heather Brunner a few large rounds totaling over $300M, fueled hyper-growth to a unicorn with 1,200 employees across eight global offices, serving many billions of web requests daily for 200,000 customers as one of the top-ten largest web platforms in the world, and our name on a downtown building that I remember seeing from my car seat growing up in Austin.

IT Watchdogs Before that, co-founder of IT Watchdogs, a hardware + embedded software company making server-room climate and power monitors, which was also bootstrapped and profitable, sold in 2004 and is still producing its products under parent company Vertive. Investor Since 2009 I’ve been an investor and time-permitting mentor at Capital Factory, Austin’s major incubator and startup co-working space. I’ve invested in a few companies including AgentPronto, Alto, Apptronik, Armbrust Masks, Builder Prime, Cart.com, Cratejoy, Osano, Pingboard, Signup.com, SpareFoot, StackOverflow, StormPulse, SureSwift, SwimTopia, and Vitag. (And others that didn’t work out, but I’m no less proud to have been a small part of the journey.) Speaker Some folks enjoy my talks on bootstrapping and startups over the past decade.
